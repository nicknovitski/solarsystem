    %code The Shadow of Yesterday
    (known as TSoY among friends) is a roleplaying game of
    fantastic, passionate adventure in a world struggling to knit itself together
    after everything almost ended. Players of the game create a world of stories
    about the brave people who join this struggle and shape the face of the world
    to come.
  %p
    TSoY uses a rules system called
    = succeed "," do
      %code Solar System
    a game of dramatic adventure. The
    Solar System is a generic rules system, which means that it can be used for
    many different stories in all sorts of imaginary worlds. It was, however,
    originally created for The Shadow of Yesterday, for which it is uniquely
    suited. The Solar System is available in many different forms and languages on
    the Internet and in game stores.
  %p
    In TSoY the Solar System is used in conjunction with the
    %code setting
    of
    = succeed "," do
      %code Near
    an
    original fantasy world custom-built for the personable, passionate stories TSoY
    is about. This book provides the setting in a language compatible with the
    Solar System rules. We also discuss how the setting can be used when playing a
    Solar System campaign set in Near.
  %h2#history-of-near History of Near
  %p
    The Shadow of Yesterday was originally self-published in 2004 by Clinton R.
    Nixon, a canny roleplaying game designer and IT professional. At this time the
    game book included both setting and rules in one book. The second edition
    followed pretty quickly in 2005, as Clinton honed the rules system, now also
    published separately under the moniker of “Solar System”. The game has been
    pretty widely available both in game stores and the Internet in different forms
    since then.
  %p
    Clinton as a programmer is an ardent supporter of the open source movement,
    which has through the years weighted increasingly on his work as a game
    designer as well. TSoY has from its first edition on been available for free
    under the CREATIVE COMMONS licensing scheme, first under the non-commercial
    license, then without even that limitation. In 2008 Clinton released all of his
    other game designs under similar terms, completing his move towards pure open
    culture.
  %p
    The open nature of TSoY has helped it become a relatively successful game in
    terms of popularity. I myself published a Finnish translation of the game in
    2006 with Clinton’s support, and the game has been translated to other
    languages as well. Perhaps even more significantly, Clinton has been steadfast
    in his support of not only freedom from expense, but also freedom in thought:
    The Shadow of Yesterday has developed through these few short years into a
    community project, with many people all over the world interpreting the game
    and reinventing it to their needs.
  %p
    In 2008, after discussing the matter with Clinton himself, I myself decided to
    take up his challenge and do what those licenses are meant to do: I would
    create new products for the game, gathering and refining the various Internet
    discussions about Near and the Solar System rules into a new round of finished
    products. At this point I decided to split The Shadow of Yesterday into two
    separate texts: there would be SOLAR SYSTEM, the rules of the game separated
    from the fantasy setting, and THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY, a new, expanded edition
    of the setting information. This would encourage friends of the system to use
    it for other things as well, and meanwhile the setting book could be wholly
    dedicated to its own purpose, making for a leaner, meaner reference and a more
    ample and passionate reading experience. We shall see how that works out.
  %h2#what-is-tsoy What is TSoY?
  %p
    The Shadow of Yesterday is a fantasy roleplaying game that is very much defined
    by its peculiar setting, NEAR. Clinton characterizes it as “pumpkin fantasy”,
    akin to that genre of fantasy literature in which young boys leave the farm,
    take up the sword, learn of their world and their place in it, and ultimately
    redeem everything.
  %p
    Aside from pumpkin fantasy, a major influence for many of us working on TSoY
    has been the idea of pulp aesthetics as a counterpoint to genrified
    post-Tolkien, post-D&amp;D fantasy literature: Near is a very organic world (some
    would call it “gritty”) that draws pretty freely from sword &amp; sorcery imagery
    and encourages stories to go where they will regardless of conventional
    structure. So there is a definite tension between uplifting heroism and
    literary realism in this material. It is a fruitful tension that I have seen no
    need to resolve: TSoY is at once sentimental and pragmatic; it is always
    exciting to sit down to play and see what we bring to being this time.
  %p
    This is not to say that The Shadow of Yesterday is a generic fantasy game that
    suits anything and everything. To the contrary, Near has a very definite feel,
    one that is easy to recognize, as anybody who’s witnessed our frequent forum
    discussions on expanding and detailing Near can attest. To wit, Clinton even
    wrote these principles into his book:
  %ul
    %li
      No monsters: The occasional wild animal happens, but the real threats and
      antagonism reside in characters with understandable motivation.
    %li
      No gods: Mankind of Near shapes their own destiny.  This is not to say that
      faith has no power, but no gods will judge or redeem the world.
    %li
      Only people: Good and evil happen for a reason. That reason is somebody
      making them happen.
  %p
    Stories of Near are humanistic stories, and even when the protagonists might
    not be human, they are still people, and their fates speak to us on that level.
    Read this as a refutation of certain sorts of fantasy literature and
    roleplaying if you will.
  %p
    There is more to Near in general, such as the Sky Fire and the Year of Shadow,
    but those are incidental matters of history, not underlying thematic purpose.
  %h2#acknowledging-sources Acknowledging Sources
  %p
    I should note that much in this book derives from the community of interested
    roleplayers. While I’ve written the words, often the ideas come from other
    works or discussions we’ve had over the years with others enticed by The Shadow
    of Yesterday. Many of the words I’ve even borrowed directly from others,
    especially Clinton’s to-the-point prose in the original THE SHADOW OF
    YESTERDAY.
  %p
    Aside from Clinton, whose influence is obvious, I have to commend Josh
    Culbertson, a long-term contributor in related forums. His “southern
    initiative”, as I’ve come to call a spate of discussion threads in the spring
    of 2008, was central in inspiring me to take up this work. With Josh’s kind
    permission I’ve adapted freely from his vision in bringing the southern
    continent and other ideas of his into this new form. Anybody interested in the
    origins of many ideas in this book should visit the forums at
    %a.reference{:href => "http://www.indie-rpgs.com"} the Forge
    for the original discussions that gave rise to what
    we have here.
  %p
    In addition to Clinton and Josh there are of course many others whose ideas,
    critique and imagination have contributed in different ways and degrees to my
    work here. At least Troels, Harald Wagener, Dave Michael, Sami Koponen, João
    Mendes and my brother Jari are easy to name, and there are likely many others
    whose names escape me at the moment.
  %p
    Another set of acknowledgement goes to the various people who have helped me
    playtest the materials in the book. These are mostly my local friends who have
    graciously helped out. At least Jari and Sami above, Markku, A-P Lappi, Henrik
    Mikkonen, Pyry and Peitsa Veteli, Satu and Timo Eskelinen, Sipi Myllynen are
    easy to name, and there are probably others I forget. As this book largely
    consists of an editorial reworking of multiple sources mixed with original
    writing and design, I make a point of indicating the main sources of each
    individual chapter in rough terms at the beginning of each. I don’t nitpick
    obsessively over the matter, but that should be enough to help direct the
    reader towards the original sources in each case, if he’s interested.
  %h2#using-this-book Using this book
  %p
    First off, if you’re new to the game and don’t have the Solar System yet, we’ll
    need to fix that. The Solar System is available on the Internet for free, as
    befits its open nature, and you can also buy it in a cheap booklet from yours
    truly. There are several different versions out there from when Clinton
    actively revised the game – look for the “2008 edition” if you can, as that
    uses the same terminology I use here. Easier to follow that way.
  %p
    Looking at the Solar System, it already advises quite a bit in how to latch a
    ready-made setting into the game. Actually, I write about setting up a game in
    general there, so I won’t repeat all that now. This book is special, though, in
    that it has been written with the Solar System in mind. This makes using the
    setting most straightforward.
  %p
    I recommend reading or at least browsing through the whole book before going to
    the game table, especially if you’re the Story Guide. I’ve tried to write this
    in an entertaining manner, and to sort the material so it makes sense as a
    reading experience. The indexes at the end of the book are there to make
    referencing various details easier in play.
  %p
    Traditionally roleplaying settings have been presented in gazetteer format, so
    I should note that this book is arranged a bit differently: TSoY is as a matter
    of method a random-access work wherein geographical logic is not nearly
    definitive: rather, players need to mix and match the material for use in their
    own campaign, connecting the dots between different parts of the book. For this
    reason I decided to arrange the book with readability in mind: in actual play
    you’re going to be skipping all over the place anyway, utilizing the index and
    your own bookmarks heavily, so I might as well organize the book logically as a
    reading experience, thus:
  %dl
    %dt Front Matter
    %dd
      of the book includes introductory material, Story Guiding advice
      and the default CRUNCH LANDSCAPE of TSoY; all material that is necessary for
      most campaigns using this book. Study it well.
    %dt 1st Movement
    %dd
      consists of the material I think of as the “short Near”: it tells of Maldor,
      the empire, and what became of it after the Year of Shadow. I’ve arranged this
      material with internal coherence in mind: if you’re overwhelmed by the extent
      of the setting in whole, the 1st Movement is actually a sort of mini-setting in
      its own right, perfectly playable.
    %dt 2nd Movement
    %dd
      concerns the “Matter of Ammeni”, the steamy northern Near.  Although Clinton
      didn’t originally plan it this way, in practical play the Matter of Maldor and
      Matter of Ammeni tend to become sort of separate: a given campaign in my
      experience rarely tries to encompass material from both, it would simply be too
      sweeping.
    %dt 3rd Movement
    %dd
      is practically Josh Culbertson’s “Southern Initiative” edited through my own
      lens and connected with the rest of the setting. It concerns the lands of the
      southern continent, a Nordic fantasy wilderness that connects and impacts the
      Ruined Empire from across the ocean in unpredictable ways.
    %dt 4th Movement
    %dd
      presents a powerful general theme of the game, the issue of the Human
      Equation. The different intelligent species of Near are introduced and their
      place in the world discussed. It is a rich and useful additional angle on
      everything that came before. Not mandatory for a lighter campaign by any means,
      but useful for everybody.
    %dt 5th Movement,
    %dd
      finally, is a segue of possibilities. I’ve written this book with an eye
      towards the future and inclusiveness, with no regard for a setting canon. This
      part consequently gathers in one place various ideas, shards and notions that
      might prove fruitful in the future as we continue play and work on this
      imaginary playground of ours.
    %dt Back Matter
    %dd
      includes the essential indexing. This book is pretty extensively concerned
      with rulesmechanical crunch, so I’ve tried to offer enough tools for finding
      what you need in the midst of play.
  %p
    Although I’ve made a point of grouping the material a bit in the above manner,
    do not for a moment entertain the idea that I’d want you to limit your
    practical play to one or two parts of the book. I just found that the book made
    a better reading experience when I gave it slightly more structure than a huge
    dictionary of articles in alphabetic order would have had.
  %h2#to-interpret-canon To Interpret Canon
  %p
    While writing this book I have had to think a lot about what roleplaying game
    settings mean and how my and others’ play of TSoY differs from how setting
    material is usually used in roleplaying. Issues such as “gregging” (the actual
    verb used by Glorantha fans when the canonical setting is changed by Greg
    Stafford) or “metaplot” (a big issue with many ‘90s roleplaying games that
    included a prose narrative that progressed and made changes to the setting of
    the game through various sourcebooks) have made me wonder how come our attitude
    in playing TSoY with its relatively elaborate setting has never stumbled on
    these kinds of issues.
  %p
    I remember vividly how in 2006 or so somebody asked on Clinton’s forums about
    “Oran”, a vaguely referenced land and people that gains hardly a mention in
    Clinton’s TSoY. The answers to that thread consisted of no less than three
    separate visions of what Oran might be – one of them by the creator of the
    setting. Not once in that discussion did we have any confusion about the truth
    of the matter: Oran would have to be, by necessity, whatever a given campaign
    or writer would want it to be, whether that’d be savage falconers, homosexual
    Arabs or a lost colony of the empire. (Check chapter 28 for what I ultimately
    made of that discussion.)
  %p
    This is a lesson in using setting material in roleplaying, one that TSoY puts
    to use in a most fruitful manner: Near as a literary entity is strictly
    secondary to the art performed upon this stage we craft in words and pictures.
    A roleplaying setting must be solid in play, but this does not mean that a
    setting book has to have automatic credibility against the desires of the
    players: the group and the Story Guide (according to his task as backstory
    authority) should consider a setting book, no matter how well-crafted, a series
    of inspiration and suggestions only.
  %p
    I do not write about this because I’d need to explain this ethos to old friends
    of TSoY. I’m explaining a fundamental difference in attitude to new readers so
    that you may understand why there are references never explained, why the
    seemingly objective descriptions differ in content, why all rules systems are
    partially unfinished and why I break immersion all the time to talk about why
    the setting is built the way it is. There simply isn’t any more objective
    reality behind the curtain than we please to pretend from moment to moment in
    our play.
  %h3#nature-of-the-beast Nature of the Beast
  %p
    Based on the above, a necessity occurs: just as I don’t consider this book a
    canon to follow, I do not consider it a product so much as a source. By this I
    mean that I find more value in this book as a source of inspiration than as a
    complete, pre-packaged gaming experience.
  %p
    I struggled for a while to find words for what exactly I mean here, so I
    devised a simile: when somebody writes a book about Chess, we do not say that
    his book is Chess. In the exact same way, while this book gives you everything
    you need to start playing TSoY, the book is not THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY itself.
    It’s just a source, of which there are quite a few nowadays, starting with
    Clinton’s original books and ranging through various web materials to
    translated language editions. My hope is that you approach this book like a
    book on Chess: it explains the rules and helps you begin, but it’s not
    everything there is to the game, and it’s certainly not the final authority on
    it. That authority is the Grandmaster who schools you at the board in actual
    play.
  %h3#continuing-from-here Continuing from Here
  %p
    This book is full of material, enough for a hundred campaigns. If there is
    anything you don’t understand, want examples for or want to know more about,
    don’t hesitate to ask me or other TSoY players about our own notions. I love to
    speculate about the Worst War or the Abandoned Coast or how equipment rules can
    be abused, or what lies beyond the Eastern Ocean, and why its name has a
    compass direction when it’s the only Ocean out there. Alongside other things
    this book being a reference work means that it’s supposed to be used in
    conjunction with your real play and other sources, not as a solitary canon.
%section#campaigning
  %header
    %h1 Campaigning
    %h2 Story Guide Advice
  %p
    This chapter is a summation of notes for the Story Guide working with TSoY.
    This material might not be that interesting or necessary for a player-type, but
    you’ll of course make your own call.
  %h2#the-first-session The First Session
  %p
    The basic procedure for starting a TSoY campaign is for the whole group to
    gather for a planning session, just like I describe in SOLAR SYSTEM. When using
    TSoY, the Story Guide often ends up being the person who has studied the
    setting a bit and imagined using it, so he is in a good position to tell about
    it to the other players. Tell small, general stories, one might say. Answer
    questions. Provide a picture of the sort of stories that will be created and
    the characters that will perform the main roles.
  %p
    Many groups go into this sort of process topdown, by describing a setting in
    general terms of setting history first and continuing to the details. That’s
    fine if the group works well with that sort of approach, but I’ve personally
    found that an ordered top-down process is more for the comfort of the person
    explaining things than for utility: the rest of the group won’t really care and
    perhaps shouldn’t care of the generalities before you’ve nailed down the
    particulars.
  %p
    As an alternative, consider leaving history and geography at the door and
    working with concrete images and concrete situations. What the players need to
    know and want to know is not necessarily the history of Absolon and Hanish
    (page 56), but the fact that now a people lies in slavery while black hearted
    men reach for immortality. If the latter is what excites the group, then
    perhaps that is what should be offered first.
  %p
    When the group has latched onto a FOCAL POINT of the setting, such as the
    ever-popular Zaru slavery issue (chapter 10), character generation can commence
    in relation to this common situation. Players can choose to create characters
    who are directly involved, or they can choose to play outsiders, but the
    important thing is that they know which their character will be by figuring out
    the character’s relationship to the focal point. I’ve managed to make a mess of
    TSoY myself by going into the game characters first, so I can’t stress enough
    the importance of first having the group (or, conceivably, the Story Guide
    alone) choose the focal point around which the campaign will revolve.
  %p
    Near is a big place full of possibilities for play, so an individual campaign
    will never need to have an integral relationship to everything in this book.
    Let go of any need to cross-reference your chosen material any further than
    seems fruitful for actual play. Ignore the parts that seem irrelevant to this
    particular campaign. Embrace setting-definition through the process of play,
    rather than looking for answers in a book.
  %p
    Everything in this setting book is written with a dual purpose: on the one hand
    it is for the players to create their characters, the protagonists of the story
    world the players will create. On the other hand, all the material is usable
    for the Story Guide in preparing the situations he needs to conduct the
    campaign.
  %h2#the-terse-near The Terse Near
  %p
    I am not sure if this is actually necessary for understanding what is to come,
    but in case it is, here is a very compact explanation for the setting of Near,
    the world that is the home for the Empire of Maldor, jungles of Qek and other
    miracles that come later. A Story Guide who prefers a top-down approach might
    start with this when introducing the game to a new group.
  %h3#what-came-before What Came Before
  %p
    Not much is known of Near before the Skyfire. This was the age of myth for most
    cultures on the planet. The most prominent of these myths from Before is the
    Empire of Maldor, to which we’ll return later on.
  %h3#the-skyfire The Skyfire
  %p
    When a fiery dot appeared on the sky, people all over the world were alarmed.
    When it grew larger, they were agitated. The giant asteroid, as such it likely
    was, struck the planet and nearly destroyed everything. If the Myth of the
    Skyfire is to be believed, the Last Emperor and Hanish the foreign magician
    saved the world then.
  %h3#the-year-of-darkness The Year of Darkness
  %p
    After the Skyfire disappeared, the world was cast in darkness as clouds of ash
    rose to the skies. The earth first broke, and then froze. The darkness lasted a
    full year, or perhaps a generation. Nine tenths of the population of Near
    perished, and the survivors were left with nothing.
  %h3#the-moon The Moon
  %p
    When the Year of Darkness ended, the Moon rose to the skies for the first time.
    It was received with fear, and quickly it became the object of superstition and
    magic. The Moon is the part of the world that is now lost, for it broke away
    from Near into a world of its own.
  %h3#what-is-now What is now
  %p
    Now is perhaps a hundred years after the Skyfire. The myth of the Skyfire says
    300 years. The world is being rebuilt, or rediscovered, as only the mightiest
    powers withstood the Year of Darkness unscathed. The world is in flux,
    civilization and life itself still in danger of extinguishing. The world is
    broken, and only courage may rebuild it.
  %p
    I will be providing similar run-downs of individual concepts through the book
    for the benefit of a setting-introducing-person; I know personally how annoying
    it can be to try to info-dump even the bare necessities of a setting to a new
    group. Hopefully some pre-thought paragraphs that can be directly read out will
    help in this a bit.
  %h2#using-the-crunch Using the Crunch
  %p
    Having a book full of rules material makes for a quite different play
    experience with the SOLAR SYSTEM than starting from an empty table would.
    Consequently, the Story Guide might consider how to best leverage the resources
    under his guidance.
  %p
    One thing I myself tend to do is to discourage players from seeing the setting
    material as a selection of character options: not only (as I’ve been repeating
    already in the book) are all the materials in the book only suggestions, but
    the purpose of the setting materials is not so much to encourage character
    optimization as to provide ideas for how to express the fiction of the game in
    the rules mechanics. Sometimes I get players who presume that everything in the
    book is to be considered as resources characters are entitled to, and I think
    that this sort of thing tends to lessen the experience a bit.
  %p
    So what I do instead is to encourage the players to start with simple
    characters that’ll then grow organically through the game into whatever
    direction fate and player choices dictate. As the Story Guide I like to take on
    the job of consulting with the players on how their characters grow and
    develop: the players do not need to go through long lists of character options
    because I’ll be throwing things out for them in the fiction of the game.
    Instead of going through a list of options for what he’d like to spend his
    Advances on, I like to see players work with what the setting is offering: a
    character might encounter an Uptenbo master who offers to teach him, or he
    might decide to become a wizard and seek tutelage in that, or he might have to
    learn advanced survival skills and knot-making in the jungles of Qek just
    because he happened to get stranded there. All of these options and more are so
    much more interesting when they follow and inspire the fiction of the game
    rather than being necessitated by a systematic study of crunch materials
    conducted by a player.
  %p
    Often you need to do nothing more complex than utilize the crunch fully in
    creating secondary characters, and make sure that those characters get to
    engage the game mechanically. For example, a great way to introduce a new
    culture into the game is to create some characters that use the new crunch and
    have them come into contact with a player character. This allows the players to
    see how the new crunch works, inspiring them to consider new options for their
    own character.
  %p
    My point in this is not to ask the Story Guide to limit other players in how
    they engage with the game (this book, as all materials, is for everybody), but
    rather to ask him to consider his responsibilities in the SOLAR SYSTEM to be
    expanded when this sort of crunch-heavy setting is dropped onto his lap: in
    addition to everything else, the Story Guide should now make sure that the
    players do not need to make the reference book their best ally in providing
    exciting character development options. There’s even no need to create your own
    additions to the crunch, just being active and inventive in bringing the
    existing material to the fore is enough. There’s quite a difference in just
    having a given Secret sit on the page as compared to having a character in the
    game actually possess it and be willing to teach it to your character.
  %h2#campaign-themes Campaign Themes
  %p
    Near is a fantasy world with the makings of your typical historical romance –
    there are humble farmers, evil tyrants, high mountains, wide rivers and all
    that stuff you’d expect. The world is just recovering from disaster as
    fractured societies slowly knit themselves back together, often in completely
    new forms. It’s a time of heroes, as the direction of the world and even its
    very survival are at stake.
  %p
    The numerous cultures of Near have many differences. Their differing values and
    material lifestyles take them into conflict as old routes of travel are opened.
    A big part of the game is to create characters that represent or contrast with
    cultures in the focal point of the campaign; player characters can clash with
    each other as representatives of different cultures, or they can come as
    strangers into such situations.
  %p
    Another large theme of Near is humanity; no gods, no monster as I explained in
    the Introduction. The so-called “old species” are a number of drastically
    different creatures such as humans, goblins and elves, all of which share the
    world and society with each other. Then there are the new creatures that have
    come with the broken world, in their own way both human and bestial. All of
    these people have identity issues that need to be resolved for a hero to truly
    emerge.
  %p
    Finally, Near has magic. Amazing feats are possible for heroes, but only at the
    price of their identity: all magics and other sources of personal power are
    rooted in culture or even species, making the choice of tools a choice of
    values for a hero.
  %h3#themes-in-conflict Themes in conflict
  %p
    While TSoY doesn’t fit directly into a given genre, it has a certain feel that
    the Story Guide will do well to consider. TSoY is a very human fantasy, which
    leads to certain rules of thumb when the Story Guide executes his
    responsibilities in dramatic coordination. For instance:
  %dl
    %dt Death:
    %dd
      It is usually not proper in TSoY to have stakes in conflict concern outright
      death of another character. Extended conflicts or helplessness due to Harm are
      thus needed to permanently kill named characters, while extras may die as part
      of narration on the way to objectives. (Note that somebody a player character
      specifically wants to kill can hardly be an extra, can they?) This means that
      usually the Story Guide may only declare player character death as conflict
      issue after a player decides to extend the conflict, not before. Seeming death
      (dropping into a gorge and never leaving a body) is still very much on the
      table, of course.
    %dt Human worth:
    %dd
      Extras are only extras as long as they don’t have names or stated interests.
      There are no social classes or types of people constrained into insignificance
      by genre stricture, as tends to be the case in chivalric romance and most other
      fantasy genres ever since. What this means is that there are no object people
      that are systematically victimized and ignored as sources of conflict without
      dramatic concern for their individuality and intent; anybody may prove
      important, be they slave or king.
  %h2#of-cultural-sources Of Cultural Sources
  %p
    As TSoY is a shared endeavor, I can’t really give a definite list of useful
    sources. I could make a list of the sorts of culture that have influenced me on
    my part when playing in Near, but I desist: it’d just be that same list of
    seminal fantasy literature you’d get from Wikipedia and any number of other
    fantasy roleplaying games: just look for “sword &amp; sorcery”, “pulp fantasy”,
    “pulp horror”, “Tolkien”, “feminist science fiction”, “military scifi”,
    “Glorantha”, “Dungeons &amp; Dragons”, “historical novel”, “libertarianism”,
    “Romanticism”, “neopaganism”.
  %p
    You probably know the seminal authors already, or if you’re young and don’t – I
    can’t guarantee it, but you’ll probably have a much better time reading the
    Masters than my book. In any case TSoY is for me a very wide organic writing
    and playing experience, one that allows me to detach from formulaic
    expectations of genre and just play the setting and rules, playfully shifting
    from genre to genre and throwing cultural references like they were cherry
    pits. I hope the game works the same way for you.
  %p
    I should mention that Clinton gives Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber as the
    main influences of the original TSoY book. You will certainly not be far off if
    that’s the sort of setting you expect, although there are many other things
    here as well.
  %h2#character-creation Character creation
  %p
    The next couple of chapters introduce the core CRUNCH LANDSCAPE for a campaign
    set in Near. There are Abilities, Secrets and Keys that are usually available
    to all characters that want them. Many cultures in the setting use their own,
    more specific crunch for accomplishing some of the things covered here, but
    many concerns are shared by all.
  %p
    When creating characters for THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY, the convention is for the
    player to choose one specific CULTURE his character belongs to. The player then
    creates the character using only the general crunch and the culture-specific
    material for the culture in question. What is a “culture” in this sense is up
    to the group – I could see prohibiting a mixture of crunch specific to certain
    social classes in some lands of Near, for example. The book doesn’t make a big
    deal of this, it doesn’t specifically list which cultures are enough of traders
    to wield the trading crunch in chapter 9, for example. You’ll just have to pay
    attention to the fiction and make choices that fit with your campaign’s intent.
  %p
    The player may also choose to make his character non-human (as opposed to the
    human default, chapter 22), in which case they may not access the
    human-specific crunch but have additional options related to their species.
    Nonhuman characters are still members of a culture just like humans, so they
    can use that crunch as well.
  %p
    I should emphasize that the culture limitation does not mean that characters
    can’t adopt another culture during play; to the contrary, this is often a
    matter of great emphasis in the character’s story. During play crunch is chosen
    normally, so characters can learn anything they have the reasonable background
    or mentors for. The culture limitation is there to emphasize the cultural
    theme, not to limit the fiction itself.
  %p
    It is not uncommon for the group to coordinate so that all the player
    characters are members of the same 1-2 cultures at the focal point of the
    campaign. For example, players might all agree to create characters living in
    the same town in Maldor. The choice to play an outsider in this set-up is a
    strong one as well, for such outsiders naturally become pivots and judges of
    the local situation.
  %p
    Another approach is the classical adventure fantasy paradigm: have all players
    create characters out of the material they are most interested in, getting a
    mix of cultures from all over Near, but also require the characters to be
    severed from their society and already adrift, looking for purpose; some
    heavy-handed dramatic coordination from the Story Guide will then get all of
    these colorful, idiosyncratic individuals mixed up with the focal point of the
    campaign, at which point they can take sides and proceed with the scenario.
    Even a traditional adventure party is a possibility here, at least for a time.
  %h3#default-pools Default Pools
  %p
    Characters for the Shadow of Yesterday are customarily created with 11 Pool
    points distributed between the three default Pools of VIGOR, INSTINCT and
    REASON. They are accompanied by the default PASSIVE ABILITIES, as we’ll see in
    the next chapter.

        The character’s capability for enduring physical pain and fatigue, whether caused by
        climate, injury or great exertion. Poisons are a particularly serious example in Near.
      %dt#react-i React (I)
      %dd
        The character’s ability of thinking and acting quickly and clearly, as useful for

        fantasy convention that falls here as well.

        The character’s strength of will and resolve in the face of adversity, stress or

  %p
    Abilities are the “venues of conflict” in Solar System, being the means by
    which heroes channel their will. In TSoY we have a pretty large swath of common
    Abilities available to all characters – for example, a character might choose
    to approach convincing another by the means of CHARM (I), DECEIT (I) or
    SPEAKING (R), and that doesn’t even cover the less generic culture-specific
    options or newly created Abilities. The purpose of this rich texture is to pay
    homage to traditional fantasy adventuring sensibilities: players are encouraged
    to pick up lots of different Abilities for their characters, and it’s easier to
    encounter situations where a character’s Ability is just MEDIOCRE (0) when
    there are lots of different Abilities floating about in the headspace of the
    group.
  %p
    This is not to say that the Story Guide should use the large number of
    Abilities to punish characters; as always, an Ability is only as relevant as
    the group allows it to be. Regardless, the slightly grim environment of Near
    benefits from the fact that players are encouraged to show character
    vulnerabilities, not just strengths. I’ve even been considering a character
    sheet with the common Abilities preset, just so the players don’t forget that
    they can have their character be weak once in a while as well.
  %h2#dealing-with-the-list Dealing with the list
  %p Common Abilities:
  %p
    The Common Abilities on the facing page are shared by practically all societies
    in Near. All but the most sheltered characters will know them all at MEDIOCRE
    (0) rank.
  %p
    You won’t go too far wrong if you consider the list of Abilities a list of
    examples only, but there is some hidden wisdom in what I choose to include in
    it. Here’s some advice on handling situations that might be unusual compared to
    how you might expect one to handle the fantasy genre in the SOLAR SYSTEM.
  %dl
    %dt Intimidation:
    %dd
      Usually I don’t allow this as a conflict. Rather, when characters try to
      intimidate others, the other party chooses whether they succeed and how the
      character will be treated going forward. For example, the Story Guide might
      have the target either buckle under and harbor resentment, or attack the
      intimidating player character outright. Note that if the target of intimidation
      is helpless and refuses to give in, it’s up to the other party to go through or
      not with their threats.
    %dt Healing:
    %dd
      A community of Near won’t necessarily have any dedicated health professionals.
      Lacking any real knowledge, a character may use HOUSEWORK (I) to treat simple
      injuries and illnesses. I usually limit this to the most rudimentary of
      treatments, such as bandages, splints and nursing; when these are insufficient,
      nothing much can be done.
    %dt Fighting:
    %dd
      Aside from BRAWL (V), there is no universal martial discipline available – the
      role of violence is different enough in the various societies of Near. A
      character that wants to be a disciplined martial artist needs to learn such
      arts and mindsets from a specific culture.
    %dt Archery:
    %dd
      Not available to everybody.  In fact, unless you count throwing rocks with
      SPORTS (V), characters wanting to resolve conflicts with missile weapons need
      cultural Abilities. For others missile weapons might delay a conflict or change
      details about it, but the actual resolution will hinge on other things.
    %dt Stealth:
    %dd
      All sorts of sneaking about and hiding cleverly are accomplished with either
      WOODCRAFT (R) or THIEVERY (I), depending on the environs, purpose and the whim
      of the group. Surprising someone to mug or murder them is a fine application of
      THIEVERY (I), for example.
    %dt Forgery:
    %dd
      THIEVERY (I) can deal with this, but only if the character can write in the
      first place. This might require the SECRET OF SCRIBING if the group is using
      that distinction, or it might just require having a background in a literate
      culture like Maldorian courts.
    %dt Lore:
    %dd
      VAGRANCY (I) deals with the news of the present world, STORYTELLING (R) with
      history and stories. I like to use plenty of various lore checks to find out
      where player and character knowledge diverges; the intent is not to hide things
      from the players, but to give them tools for crafting entertaining situations.
      So the player would indeed know that his character is now romancing a witch,
      even if the naive fool himself didn’t. This can then be used by the player in
      portraying his character. If your group isn’t so hot for this sort of thing, no
      need to have lore checks at all.
    %dt Convincing others:
    %dd
      CHARM (I) and SPEAK (R) may well be used to sway another character. In the
      case of player characters, it is a good idea to ask the player of the opposing
      character to validate the conflict stakes, as he is the leading expert at the
      table on what the character might be willing to do; if the player feels that
      his character really can’t be talked over in this situation even with
      circumstantial penalty dice, the conflict may still cause Harm from
      uncertainty, shame or other such social considerations. Thus, instead of “I
      convince him to kill himself out of shame” it’s more reasonable to have stakes
      along the lines of “he takes a MAJOR (4) Harm as I shame him”.
    %dt Arts and crafts:
    %dd
      If it can’t be done with CRAFTWORK (I), chances are that some culture in the
      book holds the lost knowledge. Other cultures make do without.
    %dt Noticing things:
    %dd
      For the most part there are no Abilities for noticing things because noticing
      something is just set-up, not conflict. REACT (I) is used when this is not the
      case, but mostly it should be assumed that the characters notice what they need
      to notice for the scene to find its dramatic purpose.
    %dt Useless Abilities:
    %dd
      This is not so much the case with the common Abilities, but the cultural stuff
      later in the book includes some quite marginal cases. It is good to remember
      several things about this: dramatic coordination can be used to bring narrowly
      useful and exotic Abilities to the fore; the player can play towards his
      Abilities and use even a tenuous connection to justify a support check;
      choosing a weird Ability in itself signals a certain degree of willingness to
      wait and see whether it becomes a dead reminder of the character’s past or a
      surprising, fresh focus for some different play.
    %dt Leverage and Secrets:
    %dd
      TSoY has a boatload of Secrets, much more than can be used during one
      campaign. It is extremely important for the players to understand that only
      content introduced into play is pertinent: disallowing a character from trying
      to set up an ambush with a normal Ability check because the book has a separate
      Secret of Ambushing or an Ambushing Ability somewhere in there would be abusing
      the content; the real crunch landscape of the game is only what the players
      willfully choose to include into their game, not what I might have written into
      this book. If this seems vague, meditate on the SECRET OF LANGUAGE until it
      becomes clear.

    %dl.docutils
      %dt Animal Ken (I)
      %dd Use ANIMAL KEN as the general social Ability for interacting with animals. Domesticated animals may follow orders; wild ones will just understand to go away. Most cultures in Near have domesticated animals that are handled with this Ability. Those cultures that train riding animals either expand this Ability with a Secret or train the rider in a specialized Ability.
      %dt Barter (I)
      %dd Most of Near has devolved into a barter economy, so the rarity of money complicates trade. Experience with trade also allows the character to evaluate the value of things to others. Use BARTER to find out whether a character’s wealth of the moment is enough to make a purchase, or what he might have to sacrifice to make the price.
      %dt Brawl (V)
      %dd Natural propensity for violence, uninformed by any finer discipline. Generally speaking a brawler will fight in a rage and limited in technique, which makes the use of sophisticated weapons inefficient and special technique all but impossible.
      %dt Charm (I)
      %dd Giving good impressions and making friends. Useful in delivering compliments and convincing others by subtle and personal means. The primary Ability for romantic conquest, should an Ability be required.
      %dt Craftwork (I)
      %dd Most cultures have traditions of creating elaborate art from wood, bone or other materials. While HOUSEWORK (R) is enough to create simple tools, this Ability is used when mere function is not enough, but beauty is desired as well. Items created with craftwork may reflect meaning and are reasonable as individual Effects that can influence people in different ways.
      %dt Deceit (I)
      %dd Delivering lies with a straight face, pretty much. Opposed by RESIST (R) when a character tries to perceive the lie for what it is. DECEIT and SPEAKING (R) overlap and support each other naturally when lies are delivered by a glib tongue. I’m not entirely consistent with DECEIT myself all the time; sometimes I allow characters to lie and mislead with CHARM (I). Caveat emptor.
      %dt Hard Work (V)
      %dd Most direct production in Near happens with human labor. Farming and related work is first and foremost about patience, measured use of force and experience. HARD WORK is used whenever characters want to support others with grunt work, or when they end up on the bottom ladder of a working group, or when they want to make their way honestly.
      %dt Housework (R)
      %dd Only the most well preserved or newly advanced communities in Near feature large degrees of specialized labor. Most of what makes people happy and comfortable from day to day is made in the home with this Ability, such as cooking, craftwork, folk medicine and so on. Essential for the functional household. HOUSEWORK may be used to treat simple injuries and illnesses.
      %dt Music (I)
      %dd A character’s skill with instruments and song. Music is beautiful and universal to life in Near, but its usefulness is a subtle thing. Choosing this Ability as a major facet for a character is to choose to chase mirages that only occasionally perform truly. In other words, it takes some work to maneuver the game into a situation where music will be useful in conflict.
      %dt Pray (V)
      %dd This Ability is used to conduct rituals and focus the mind towards a higher power in meditation. Sometimes faith can move mountains, or at least support other Abilities at critical moments.
      %dt Speak (R)
      %dd The skill of explaining yourself well. Useful for arguing a point or delivering a rousing speech. Speaking usually requires some sort of valid point to work from, though. Use SPEAK for any social conflicts where substantial issues decided with reason are at stake.
      %dt Sports (V)
      %dd Sports are an important status practice, especially for men who use them to establish prominence. The same Ability is used to resolve general athletic situations, such as swimming, climbing, jumping and so on.
      %dt Storytell (R)
      %dd All but the most civilized places have lost their literary culture. What they have instead are storytellers, the sons and daughters of people who might have been erudite in their time. This Ability is used to know the old things and tell the truth of them, as well as to combine the old stories into new ones.
      %dt Thievery (I)
      %dd Thievery is experience in casing targets, picking pockets, stealthy entrance, confidence tricks and other unsavory practices that come with societal hostility and willingness to break norms. Experts are unlikely outside major urban centers.
      %dt Vagrancy (I)
      %dd Beggars and vagabonds are common in the Near of today. They learn how to freeload and draw a meager livelihood from the gratitude of strangers. Vagrancy is also useful for knowing things about the wider world. Aside from vagrants, any well traveled character might have this Ability.
      %dt Woodcraft (R)
      %dd Most of Near is temperate, consisting of woodlands, grasslands, wetlands and highlands. This Ability concerns survival skills in these wilderness environments, such as recognizing the flora and fauna, remembering their properties, tracking and trapping them. Extreme environments, such as dense jungle or bare tundra are wont to cause penalty dice, as is simple unfamiliarity with a specific terrain.

      %a#creating-new-abilities{:name => "creating-new-abilities"} Creating new Abilities
    %p
      In actual play of TSoY I’ve long used the Ability list more as a guide than an
      authoritative source for what can be turned into an Ability. Partially this has
      been because I haven’t sat down to sketch my own perfect list until now, but
      part has been the fact that some Abilities should be developed for individual
      campaigns only. For example, if your character concept is an optician or some
      such, and you expect the play to center on how he helps everybody with
      eyeglasses, I simply can’t predict that, and even if I could, all the crunch I
      wrote for the optician would be useless overhead for other campaigns.
    %p
      Thus: remember that this book is a reference, the real crunch landscape is the
      one that is actualized by your individual campaign. It might have quite
      different Ability lists from what this general treatise suggests.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#local-ability{:name => "local-ability"} Local Ability
      %p
        To give a less extreme example of what I mean, consider a street urchin sort of
        character that knows the city like the back of his hand. This is perfectly
        feasible in a fantasy punk campaign set in Maldor or Kalderon or such urban
        environment. The Ability:
      %blockquote
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Local (specify) (R)
          %dd
            The character has lived in a certain area for a long time. Choose a
            geographical area, community subculture or other such living environment. The
            character can find people, places and lore related to the locality with this
            Ability, and he is considered a member of the community here.
      %p
        I didn’t put this in the general list because these Abilities need to be
        developed on a per-campaign basis: for a far-traveling campaign you’d want
        something like LOCAL (MALDOR) (R), while for something set in a single,
        sprawling city you’d want LOCAL (KALDERON) (R). Normal Ability-creation in that
        regard.
  .section
    %h3
      %a#missing-abilities{:name => "missing-abilities"} Missing Abilities
    %p
      TSoY is more or less a flagship setting for SOLAR SYSTEM, so it’s pretty
      complex. Sometimes characters encounter each other in the weirdest of
      situations and simply have asymmetric Abilities. How to resolve conflicts when
      characters lack obvious Abilities?
    %p
      The precept of Solar System is that Abilities simultaneously reflect character
      identity and allowable venues of conflict resolution. What this boils down to
      is that a character that lacks a MEDICINE (R) Ability, say, can’t resolve
      conflicts through this venue; he fails automatically when the issue is whether
      a disease will run its course or not. The only way for the group to avoid this
      stark reality is by manipulating the TURNING-POINT of the conflict: perhaps the
      issue is not whether a character can heal another, but whether he can travel
      quickly enough to bring a remedy from far away? Or perhaps success depends on
      being able to convince a traveling doctor to help? As long as the player can
      re-frame a problem in terms his character understands, he can tackle the
      conflict from the new direction and be victorious.
    %p
      When two characters conflict against each other, both have a say in where the
      turning-point of the conflict forms. For example, if the issue is over a
      military campaign conducted by imperial Maldor using BATTLE (R) against a
      primitive tribe without similar strategic culture, it might well be that the
      imperial forces would win with a simple, uncontested Ability check: their
      tactical supremacy allows them to win the war without a fight. A player
      character on the other side, however, is well within his rights to influence
      the unfolding narrative to include a concrete fight scene wherein his
      character’s BRAWL (V) or other melee combat Abilities come to determine the
      fate of the war: whether the war between an empire and a primitive tribe comes
      down to brawling or logistics or some completely different Ability is a nuanced
      dance of scene framing, narration, player initiative and stakes negotiation: I
      can’t give a straight answer because this largely is the game of SOLAR SYSTEM.
      Play the game and find out!
.section
  %h2
    %a#secrets-points-of-contact{:name => "secrets-points-of-contact"} Secrets: Points of Contact
  %p
    While most of the really cool stuff is found in the cultural write-ups, Near
    does have an array of generic Secrets available to all characters. The purpose
    of these Secrets is simple: they’re here to cover all the really basic stuff
    that should be assumed as a baseline for all characters. The color is also
    generic and concerns simple things like “this character hits really hard” –
    players should feel free to embellish here to whatever degree they want.
  %p
    Another, traditional reason for the general Secret list is that it sort of sets
    the tone and helps newcomers get a grip on character creation. Mostly the
    general list provides grounding for fantasy tropes – they show simple tricks
    that you’d expect to encounter in the fantasy genre, providing a basis for when
    you want to develop more simple stuff yourself. I often set up new players with
    the open list, telling them to browse it through a bit to get a sense for what
    sorts of things characters in TSoY are expected to do and have.
  %p
    Culturally the group may wish to assume that all civilizations of Near have
    their own tricks and heritage that is culturally different but amounts to the
    same thing mechanically. Thus the SECRET OF MIGHTY BLOW of a Maldorite might in
    the fiction represent different martial training than it does for a Khalean,
    for example. Alternatively, a given Secret, such as the SECRET OF BODHISATTVA,
    might genuinely be universal, so that two enlightened characters from opposite
    sides of the world recognize in each other the same truth. It depends on the
    Secret; I’d assume it obvious that something like the SECRET OF CONDITIONING
    requires some back-story specification to find out where the mechanical effect
    comes from for this character. I might gloss over it in practice with a group
    that doesn’t care, but were the issue to ever come up, having an explanation is
    a nice addition to the fiction.
  .section
    %h3
      %a#cultural-strengths{:name => "cultural-strengths"} Cultural Strengths
    %p
      Later, in the actual culture write-ups, there are headings for “Cultural
      Strengths”. Under these I have long lists of suggestions for how to adapt some
      of the more generic common Secrets for the culture in question. For example, I
      might list “specializations”, which are suggestions for how to use the SECRET
      OF SPECIALTY with that culture.
    %p
      Traditionally this sort of content would have been written into separate
      Secrets to emphasize how this culture is really good at swimming or whatever,
      but that goes a bit old, isn’t that helpful to you and takes a lot of space,
      frankly, so I stopped doing it and just listed everything in one long list. I
      try to separate only Secrets that have somehow strange mechanics or are
      otherwise notable.
    %p
      One thing the players might wish to do (and which was explicitly done in
      earlier editions of TSoY) is to make common Secrets based on cultural strengths
      just the slight bit more powerful than any old implementation a player might
      grab. This could range from allowing an abnormally wide specialization to
      picking two generic Secrets under one heading. This is all fine, as the Secrets
      featured in Cultural Strengths are mostly pretty low-key stuff anyway. Thus, to
      pick an old TSoY example, the SECRET OF SWAMP LORE would be a Zaru SECRET OF
      SPECIALIZATION that also expanded the usage of WOODCRAFT (I) a bit.
    %p
      This might go without saying, but do treat those lists of cultural strengths as
      a list of examples to be added to as the group’s understanding of the given
      culture increases. Here more than anywhere else I just sat down and typed
      whatever came to mind, there is no great plan behind the free association that
      went into this particular piece of crunch.

      %a#mechanical-issues{:name => "mechanical-issues"} Mechanical Issues
    %p
      While most of the general Secrets are mechanically simple, this is a good place
      to introduce some overriding mechanical principles I’ve worked with while
      editing this book to shape. Some of these are terminology issues, some are new
      rules, some are optional rules. See for yourself.

      %h4
        %a#spending-pool-at-character-creation{:name => "spending-pool-at-character-creation"} Spending Pool at Character Creation
      %p
        This one always comes up, especially in the TSoY crunch landscape: when a
        player wants to start play with an Effect or a piece of equipment, do they pay
        Pool for it?
      %p
        I used to not worry about this, but the players actually seem to be happier if
        the mechanics are followed in a robust manner. So yes, have the character pay
        Pool for each Effect you roll for him in character creation. The character
        starts play with somewhat expended Pools.
      %p
        Real tough guys might want to craft several items for their character at
        character creation with the SECRET OF CREATION, as opposed to just talking it
        over with the Story Guide and setting appropriate statistics for the equipment.
        If it’s just one piece, handle it like Effects, above. If it’s several, assume
        that the character refreshes his Pools after each project. Equipment is so
        expensive to create that few characters could make more than one without
        refreshment.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#pool-spend-caps{:name => "pool-spend-caps"} Pool Spend Caps
      %p
        I noticed in writing this book that there is a boatload of Secrets in here that
        work with the Solar System Pool spending limitations. It’s that small rule that
        says that characters can buy exactly one bonus die for an Ability check with a
        Pool point from the associated Pool, but no more than one, and not from other
        Pools.
      %p
        In this text I call this rule the “Pool spend cap” of a given Ability,
        associated with a certain Pool. Thus, when I say that a Secret “removes the
        Pool spend cap”, that means you get to spend as much Pool as you want on those
        bonus dice. Pretty simple, I just thought it better to mention this for
        clarity’s sake.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#superior-leverage{:name => "superior-leverage"} Superior Leverage
      %p
        Many Secrets in the book reference this concept. You can read about the
        theoretical background I went through with it in chapter 4, but it’s better to
        mention it here as well.
      %p
        When a character has “superior leverage”, it’s just my technical speak for the
        fact that his position in the fiction makes it infeasible for his opponents to
        engage him in conflict. For example, a character standing on top of his house
        and throwing rocks at his enemies has superior leverage – he can hurt his
        enemies, but they can’t feasibly hurt him. Superior leverage is the next step
        down from two circumstance penalty dice: the situation is even worse for the
        opponent.
      %p
        When a character has superior leverage, conflict rules are not engaged at all:
        the opponent loses the conflict automatically, one might say. One might also
        take the situation into extended conflict were one so inclined, but superior
        leverage works there as well: if the opponent insists on attacking the superior
        leverage directly, he will lose every round of conflict automatically.
      %p
        The proper method for working around superior leverage is not to engage in
        conflict; the whole idea of the concept is to formalize and speak about the
        situations in fiction where everybody from audience down understands that
        conflict is not feasible. Like escaping stormtroopers in STAR WARS, nobody in
        the audience questions Luke &amp; Han’s choice to not attack and try to conquer the
        Death Star singlehandedly.
      %p
        Rather, characters work their way around superior leverage by avoiding it.
        Change the conditions so you don’t need to encounter strength with weakness. If
        your opponent has superior leverage in a debate, stab him. If he has too many
        stormtroopers, try to talk them over. Or perhaps bring in your own superior
        leverage to match him, if you can.
      %p
        Often characters can engage superior leverage meaningfully with PARTIAL
        conflict stakes, where the weaker party has less to win and more to lose. While
        the opponent might hit you with a stone and injure you, you might be able to
        get up to the roof to attempt restraining him in a further conflict, for
        example.
      %p
        Last, to clarify: superior leverage is a judgment on the fiction of the game,
        one which the Story Guide makes when assigning stakes for the conflict. Some
        crunch might explicitly assign a character with superior leverage in certain
        situations, but this doesn’t mean that the Story Guide can’t give it to anybody
        by declaration. This is a normal part of the leverage evaluation the Story
        Guide does in the SOLAR SYSTEM rules: conflicts are only ever played out when
        both parties have some chance of success.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#overflow-dice{:name => "overflow-dice"} Overflow dice
      %p
        Some Secrets, such as the equipment rules (chapter VI), make use of the concept
        of OVERFLOW DICE. These are any dice that were left over after choosing the
        three best or worst dice in an Ability check. So if you rolled a total of five
        dice, for example, then you’d necessarily have two dice left over after
        choosing the three that actually contribute to the check result. Those are the
        overflow dice.
      %p
        Obviously enough, when you have overflowdependent crunch in play, don’t mess up
        the dice on the table when rolling. Technically, the overflow does not go away
        before the whole Ability check procedure ends, as it’s possible to add bonus
        and penalty dice into the roll several times, which also adds to the overflow
        again and again.
      %p
        When using overflow dice, I allow players to choose freely to downgrade their
        result to modify their overflow. So if you really want a ‘+’ die in your
        overflow and have one in your standing dice, go on and switch the ‘+’ die out.
        I sometimes even allow desperate players to roll extra penalty dice into their
        check if they really must get overflow any way they can; feel free to
        experiment with this, these are pretty new rules compared to most of the SOLAR
        SYSTEM toolbox.
      %p
        What you actually do with overflow dice depends on the Secrets that use them,
        but the general idea is that I wanted to create an array of Secrets that would
        make high numbers of bonus dice a bit more useful for the dedicated character.
        TSoY has traditionally had a pretty bonus-dicey crunch landscape, so rolling a
        +3 in an Ability check has not been that difficult; with the idea of overflow
        dice we can create crunch that rewards or punishes the excess dice.
      %p
        Overflow dice that are used for some purpose are always consumed from the
        table. This mostly matters if you have some wacky crunch that uses the overflow
        in several different ways.

      %h4
        %a#aggravated-harm{:name => "aggravated-harm"} Aggravated Harm
      %p
        Several Secrets in the book use the concept of AGGRAVATED Harm, which, as you
        might imagine, is always some sort of extra annoying Harm. Aggravated Harm does
        not shake down and is not associated with a Pool, and can’t thus be healed
        naturally. Often specific sources describe even worse effects.
      %p
        Healing Abilities work normally on aggravated Harm. I also allow a healer to
        make an Ability check to turn all aggravated Harm equal or under the check
        result into normal Harm, which also shakes the Harm down.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#flashbacks-flashforwards-intermissions{:name => "flashbacks-flashforwards-intermissions"} Flashbacks, Flashforwards. Intermissions
      %p
        A central theme of TSoY on the most primordial poetic level is the eponymous
        shadow of yesterday. In my play this seems to come up as all sorts of flashback
        mechanics and other weird non-chronological storytelling devices. They don’t
        make an appearance often, but they are regulars in the toolbox.
      %p
        My general principle for playing scenes in nonchronological order is to refuse
        to engage in retooling character sheets. We just use the character exactly as
        he happens to be. This makes certain sorts of narrative sense (that is, this is
        how movies work), and it saves work, too. If a character is different enough in
        two time-frames, my solution of choice is to write him up as a new character
        when necessary.
      %p
        Players always play their own characters in all scenes when I play, even if
        we’ve sort of established that they did some things in the past that they now
        need to re-enact. I remind the players of what we already know, but they play
        their characters freely; that’s one of the dangers of a real flashback scene.
      %p
        When non-chronological scenes contradict established facts, a character who is
        telling the story or experiencing the memory gets to make a STORYTELLING (R)
        check so we can find out how believable this version of the events is. Others
        can conflict the story, of course. I’ve never had this happen, but I suppose
        that this method could be used between time-frames to find out which timeframe
        is actually the primary one if the game timejumps (in memories,
        non-chronological telling or actual time travel) a lot and the players are
        confused.
      %p
        Lastly: the Story Guide can always opt to replace a narratively difficult scene
        with a CUT SCENE: instead of playing a scene, one player (often the Story
        Guide) makes an expository monologue before the game continues. This is always
        the case when there are no player characters in the scene.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#limited-effects{:name => "limited-effects"} Limited Effects
      %p
        This is a variant rule I’ve found worth considering in TSoY, at least for some
        groups. The idea is that while Near is supposed to be pretty grim at times, the
        game mechanics actually provide quite a kick for characters if the players
        start really working with all the crunch available. Effects from SOLAR SYSTEM
        rules can especially be leveraged in some interesting ways with the crunch in
        this book. Gift dice don’t fare well in this environment, as their impact is
        lessened by players wielding large inherent dice pools.
      %p
        If the group feels that their game has too many bonus dice floating around,
        they might consider LIMITED EFFECTS: have Effects spent for bonus dice be
        limited to one die per check, just like Pools are. For an extra-grim take,
        count each Effect under the Pool spend cap of the Pool it derives from (rather
        than allowing one die from each Effect). In this latter method Effects are
        still worthwhile in that they save Pool for the character and might allow a
        character to tap on the Pool spend caps of several Pools when an Effect is
        applicable to a situation where the Effect and the Ability are from different
        Pools.
      %p
        It would also make sense to apply this rule only in extended conflict, akin to
        how support checks from secondary Abilities are limited.
      %p
        I’ve played both with and without this rule, and it’s not nearly mandatory.
        Rather, just like all alternate rules, it’s something to take up when and if
        the problem (too many dice in this case) comes up in play.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#fragile-effects{:name => "fragile-effects"} Fragile Effects
      %p
        Another variant rule in the same vein concerns Effects in another use, as
        direct resistance against Ability checks in conflict. Some crunch in TSoY
        provides characters with potentially pretty powerful Effects that protect them
        from other characters. Gorenite RITUAL WORKINGS, Ammenite ALCHEMY and giant
        ONE-EYES are good examples; they can be very unforgiving, almost a done deal
        against a low-Ability character.
      %p
        If the group starts to feel that such Effects protect characters too much and
        result in dramatic duds, they may consider FRAGILE EFFECTS: under this rule all
        Effects that participate in conflict directly lose an Effect level regardless
        of the conflict outcome; thus Effects ablate in use. If the opponent wins and
        tries to destroy the Effect, it is immediately destroyed, just like always.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#circumstance-penalties-to-effects{:name => "circumstance-penalties-to-effects"} Circumstance Penalties to Effects
      %p
        One last variant rule concerning Effects, or rather a Story Guide option. When
        a character encounters adverse circumstances, he suffers circumstance penalty
        dice to his Ability check. This same rule can be extended to Effects in
        advanced play by considering the Effect’s value to be one level less for each
        level of current circumstance penalty. Thus an AMAZING (4) angry mob might
        operate as just GREAT (3) in horrid weather conditions. Simple.
      %p
        I wouldn’t worry about these details with a soft beginner-type group, but if
        the group is playing hard-ball with some of the more advanced applications of
        the rules, this might become worthwhile.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#game-balance{:name => "game-balance"} Game Balance
      %p
        Because this comes up pretty often both in play and discussions, I feel that I
        should mention it explicitly here: the purpose of SOLAR SYSTEM crunch is
        usually not to be “balanced” in the sense of providing all players with
        different characters a fair shot at overcoming each other or some imaginary
        opposition in a wrestling match. To the contrary, different crunch provided in
        the game is nothing more or less than what it seems like: itemized points of
        contact between the fictional matter and mechanics of the game. The only
        balance here concerns upholding meaningful gameplay while focusing attention
        and inspiring outcomes.
      %p
        I’ve discussed this in the actual SOLAR SYSTEM rules, but it really is
        important: the very idea of playing TSoY is to deck up a couple of bad-ass
        fantasy heroes and bash them together until one’s brains come out. A themeful
        story is created when we, as audience, make judgments not only of who was
        stronger, but also who was more in the right and who would have deserved to
        win. This has nothing to do with game balance, having a hero doomed to lose
        because his cultural crunch sucks in comparison to his opponent just stacks the
        deck towards a certain story outcome. This is good, because in SOLAR SYSTEM we
        enjoy those points of contact and don’t want equalized 50/50 chances.

        These Secrets are known all over Near. Some of the bunch are little more than
        frameworks that allow the players to model details as they wish.
      .list.container
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Blessing
          %dd
            The character can bless endeavors, tools and places with a ritual of his
            faith. The player makes a PRAY (V) check to create the blessing as an Effect
            which is then moved to the recipient’s character sheet. Blessing Effects are
            spent as bonus dice; usually they manifest in the fiction only subtly, but when
            Keys are activated simultaneously, supernatural light effects or such might
            happen as well. Blessing Effects are not affected by Pool spend caps under the
            LIMITED EFFECTS variant rule. Cost: as per normal for Effects.
          %dt Conditioning (Pool)
          %dd
            The character has been especially conditioned in one of his Pools, either
            intentionally or by cruel fate. The Pool spend cap is increased by one for the
            Pool; while others can only spend one Pool point per Ability check on bonus
            dice, this character can spend two from this Pool. This Secret can be purchased
            multiple times.
          %dt Contacts
          %dd
            The character is well-traveled and knows people in many places. A VAGRANCY (I)
            or LOCAL (R) check is enough to establish that the character has in fact
            visited a given place in the past. The player may also activate this Secret to
            establish that his character has a pre-existing relationship to another
            character in the game; the player describes the relationship with a short
            phrase, while the controller of the other character establishes the attitude of
            the other character and the current state of the relationship. Cost: 1 POOL for
            locations, 3 for characters, Pool mix chosen by the Story Guide: VIGOR for
            buddies, INSTINCT for lovers and REASON for colleagues, for example.
          %dt Counsel
          %dd
            The character knows how to heal broken spirits. Sometimes this is taught, but
            most often it is instinctual kindness. When the character advises another and
            the advice is accepted, the player may make an appropriate emotional Ability
            check such as PRAY (V), MUSIC (I) or STORYTELL (R) to heal mental or social
            Harm for the target. Cost: 1 appropriate Pool
          %dt Culture (specify)
          %dd
            The character loves his people. He can use any CULTURAL STRENGTHS listed for
            the culture in question as if he had the corresponding Secret. Cost: 1 POOL
            appropriate to the situation.
          %dt Dark Rhetoric
          %dd
            The character may impose the KEY OF DESPERATION upon another character with a
            successful SPEAK (R) check. The target may RESIST (R), of course. The target
            pays for the Key normally, going into Advance debt if necessary. Cost: 2
            Instinct. Requirement: KEY OF DESPERATION
          %dt Day Labor
          %dd
            The character does not pay Pool to create Effects with the HARD WORK (V)
            Ability as long as he doesn’t possess any Vigor-based Effects.
          %dt Enhancement (Ability)
          %dd
            The character has a heroic Ability that does not have a Pool spend limit. This
            might be because of specialized initiation, exotic training or simply from
            being so cool. Regardless, the Pool spend cap for this Ability is lifted
            altogether: the player can buy however many bonus dice he wants for this
            Ability.
          %dt Experience
          %dd
            Whenever the character does something notable, the player may choose to record
            his Ability check as a free Effect under this Secret. These Effects are free of
            Pool costs, but they cannot be used during the session they were recorded.
            Later the Effects can be used normally when the character encounters situations
            similar to his past experience.
          %dt Herbal Medicine
          %dd
            The character has studied natural remedies. A WOODCRAFT (R) check allows him
            to know and locate suitable herbs to treat most injuries and illnesses. The
            check may directly heal Harm or allow further checks to treat the patient (e.g.
            HOUSEWORK (R)). Cost: 1 REASON
          %dt Home Set (specify)
          %dd
            The character has a milieu particularly important to him. The player can make
            an appropriate LOCAL (R) check to force the next scene to happen there. The
            Story Guide can make the obligatory scene a cut scene if he wants. Cost: 1
            INSTINCT
          %dt Inner Meaning
          %dd
            The character’s art has an expressive spark to it regardless of his level of
            skill. A piece of art created with CRAFTWORK (I) or other suitable Ability,
            when turned into an Effect, may at the player’s choice influence anybody
            witnessing the art emotionally, akin to how MUSIC (I) would. The target may
            resist the influence with RESIST (R) against the Effect value. Cost: 1 REASON
            per check forced.
          %dt Knockback
          %dd
            The character may send others flying with his powerful blows. In extended
            conflict this can end the conflict if the player’s check was the highest of all
            during a round; such a conflict ends without resolving the stakes, making for
            an opportunity to back off. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Language (specify)
          %dd
            The character knows an extra language in addition to his own. If no character
            in the campaign has this Secret, then it’s up to the Story Guide to decide how
            much pain in the ass he wants language to be, case-by-case.
          %dt Luck
          %dd
            When the character gets GIFT DICE from others, the player gains an equal
            number of dice into his own Gift Pool to redistribute. Even if the group is not
            using Gift Dice, other players can still each give one Gift Die to this
            character to any checks they want.
          %dt Mighty Blow
          %dd
            When the character deals injury to another by violence, the player may choose
            to increase the level of Harm caused by paying VIGOR: 1 point per one level of
            increase. The maximum level of Harm is MORTAL (6), however. Cost: 1+ VIGOR
          %dt Past
          %dd
            The character has a rich and meaningful past. Whenever this backstory comes up
            in play, the player may choose to frame a flashback scene revealing a part of
            it. Play the scene as cut scene if appropriate. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
          %dt Prophecy
          %dd
            The character gets prophetic flashes. Either the player or the Story Guide may
            activate this Secret to have the player make a PRAY (V) check; the player may
            call for his character to RESIST (R) the vision, however. Success indicates
            important visions of the future or far away places, narrated by the player who
            called for the prophecy. The check result may be made into an Effect by anybody
            the prophecy pertains to (whether present or not); anybody who hears of the
            prophecy can duplicate the Effect by paying for it, making it viral. The
            prophetic Effect provides bonus dice normally, and may also be used for penalty
            dice on pertinent opposing checks. Cost: 1 VIGOR
          %dt Prophecy #2
          %dd
            The player can make a PRAY (V) check to get a look at the Key Elements list in
            advance. The Story Guide shows him as many Key Elements as the level of his
            check indicates. Cost: 1 VIGOR
          %dt Quest (specify)
          %dd
            The character has a treasure map, plan or other precepts for achieving a major
            goal, which probably involves gaining some rare Secret or Key or such. This
            Secret is replaced with the target Secret after three successful conflicts
            towards the goal: the Story Guide includes the quest in the stakes of
            appropriate conflicts. He also determines whether losing the conflict risks the
            whole plan or not.
          %dt Retrain (Ability, Pool)
          %dd
            The character has undergone some special training or exotic conditions related
            to the Ability in question. For example, he might practice a Reason-based
            musical style taught in old Maldorian art academies. The Ability is now
            associated with both its original Pool and a new Pool. The two Pools have
            separate point spend limits for this Ability. The player may also rename the
            Ability at this point to reflect the changing emphasis; this might be useful in
            moving between cultures that have similar but separate Abilities, for example.
          %dt Scribing (specify)
          %dd
            The character knows how to read and write in one writing system. If no
            character in the campaign has this Secret, then it’s up to the Story Guide to
            decide how much pain in the ass he wants literacy to be, case-bycase.
          %dt Shrew
          %dd
            The character is skilled at tugging at the heart-strings of others with their
            manipulation. The player may opt to spend a successful social Ability check
            result as penalty dice against the target character if the target opts to act
            against the advice given by the shrew. This works even for social Effects
            created in earlier scenes. The shrew does not have to be present to spend the
            dice, as long as the target remembers their earlier interaction.
          %dt Sidekick (person)
          %dd
            Choose an amiable secondary character that has no Abilities higher than the
            character’s highest. The secondary character is now assumed to stick with the
            player character and help him out of loyalty to common motives, payment or
            other suitable motive. The sidekick follows instructions for the most part; the
            Story Guide may contest individual commands with a RESIST (R) check. The
            secondary character has KEY OF SERVANT for free, but may not use any other
            Keys; the player character may not gain experience due to interaction with his
            sidekick. Should the sidekick decide to leave, he decides whether the master
            gains back the Advance spent on this Secret.
          %dt Specialty (focus)
          %dd
            The character has focused his skills to a specific direction. Choose a
            specialty that is narrower than an Ability. The character gains a free bonus
            die to any Ability check made within the specialty.
          %dt Sudden Knife
          %dd
            The character is practiced as a killer. When the player activates this Secret
            in a violent conflict, death for the losing party becomes a part of the stakes.
            Either party may voluntarily de-escalate, but as long as the assassin continues
            to seek death, he gains a boon: for each ‘ ‘ overflow die in his Ability check,
            he causes a penalty die for his target’s check (opposed checks only in extended
            conflict). Cost: 3 from the Pool associated with the current conflict Ability,
            1 from each other Pool.
          %dt Synergy (Ability, Ability)
          %dd
            The character has learned to combine the two Abilities seamlessly in
            situations that utilize both. The character may use either Ability to support
            the other in extended conflict as a normal support chain that does not expend a
            round. In normal conflicts check both Abilities simultaneously and have the
            worse check support the better, regardless of other conditions.
          %dt Vagabond
          %dd
            The character has lived among different cultures through his life. For each
            time the player takes this Secret he may add one background culture for his
            character, allowing him to use crunch from several cultures in character
            creation and later development. The cultures have to border each other
            geographically or be otherwise connected. (Note that characters can gain crunch
            from other cultures without this Secret in play. The Secret just formalizes the
            fact that the character has spent a long while with a culture and can improvise
            crunch from it like he were native.)

  %p
    In an epic fantasy setting like Near Keys are “heroic urges” – it’s easy to
    interpret Keys as expressions of the greater nature of a given protagonist
    character. Of course TSoY is also a quintessentially humane setting; all people
    are worthy of respect, and protagonists become heroes due to their
    circumstances and experiences, not due to fate alone. I won’t bore the reader
    with my patented anti-fascist fantasy lecture here, it suffices to say that I
    love playing stories of Near that are about human concerns big and small. If
    heroism should happen, it comes about due to choices made by the characters and
    not due to rigorous narrative whitewashing.

    %p
      I’ve always created new Keys as needed for the dramatic sensibilities of the
      group. I would probably read the Keys in this book as important examples and
      likely candidates, not as a limiting constraint. There is no pressure to create
      your own Keys, of course – the general list alone is more than sufficient for
      many different characters.

      %a#keys-for-secondary-characters{:name => "keys-for-secondary-characters"} Keys for secondary characters
    %p
      I don’t usually bother with Keys for secondary characters per se in TSoY;
      instead, I assume that all named secondary characters have a Key concerning
      their foremost passion of the moment, should that become pertinent.
    %p
      Secondary characters in my TSoY only really advance in experience with
      fictional events and time. So something has to happen in the fiction for the
      character’s capabilities to change, and the Story Guide judges what the change
      brings. Sidekicks and such are an exception; if a player runs the statistics of
      a given character, then the player may as well track experience points for
      them.

    %p
      Keys in TSoY tend to be quite quirky by generic SOLAR SYSTEM standards. It’s
      not that hard to make a Key completely useless without hitting the Buyoff
      condition with some of these, especially when characters can change the world.
      I handle those situations by allowing the character to regain an Advance for
      the useless Key, provided that it has really become non-applicable and not just
      difficult to use.

      %dl.docutils
        %dt Adventure
        %dd
          For the people of Near, adventure means refusing social ties; most societies
          frown upon this, but not all. Some have approved roles for people eager for
          adventure. 1xp: Go on or continue an adventure when you could back down. 2xp:
          Get into danger. 5xp: Do the impossible. Buyoff: Settle down.
        %dt Bloodlust
        %dd
          The character enjoys defeating others in combat. This Key is considered a
          virtue in almost all cultures of Near, but only when practiced in the correct
          ways by the right people. 1xp: Attack somebody. 3xp: Win a fight. Buyoff: Be
          defeated in battle.
        %dt Compassion
        %dd
          The character struggles to do right by others. Foolish sympathy is not rated
          very highly by most cultures of Near, but it exists in all. The emblematic
          scene that separates the hero from the villain comes when the former’s
          compassion gets abused by the latter. 1xp: Help those in need. 2xp: Save
          another’s life. 5xp: Get taken advantage of. Buyoff: Ignore the cries of the
          innocent.
        %dt Coward
        %dd
          The character frightens easily and can’t or won’t control it in public. The
          Key is the same whether prudence is accepted of the character socially or not.
          1xp: Show your fear to others. 3xp: Back down from a confrontation. Buyoff:
          Risk yourself voluntarily.
        %dt Cripple
        %dd
          The character is crippled or has some such permanent injury. Old age,
          blindness and lameness are fine examples. 1xp: Get pitied or scorned for your
          condition. 2xp: Suffer difficulties due to the condition. 5xp: Succeed despite
          your condition. Buyoff: Get healed of your infirmity.
        %dt Desperation
        %dd
          The character has given up hope. Broken souls are not at all rare in Near of
          today. Some of them may never heal. 1xp: Try to convince others to give up.
          3xp: Give up on something important. Buyoff: Cast aside your despair.
        %dt Faith (specify)
        %dd
          The character has a belief system that guides him. Not all cultures have
          churches, but most have religions of some sort. 1xp: The faith comes up. 2xp:
          Enact the faith in action. 5xp: Suffer for your faith. Buyoff: Abandon and deny
          your faith.
        %dt Fellowship
        %dd
          The character belongs in a fraternity of unlikely allies questing for a common
          goal. Such a bond can be the strongest of them all. 1xp: Discuss the course of
          the fellowship with the other members. 2xp: Cooperate with the fellowship to
          achieve your goals. 5xp: Side with the fellowship against your own best
          interests. Buyoff: Leave the fellowship.
        %dt Glittering Gold
        %dd
          Avarice runs in his veins. As with most character traits, a majority of
          societies considers a modicum in this regard a virtue, with a minority favoring
          extremes to either direction. 1xp: Gain material wealth. 3xp: Gain wealth at
          the expense of others. Buyoff: Give away your wealth.
        %dt Glory
        %dd
          The character hungers for renown. This is typical for heroes who don’t want to
          be seen as just a face in the crowd. 1xp: Make sure your name and deeds are
          known by bragging or seeking witnesses. 3xp: Take foolish risks to increase or
          enjoy your fame. Buyoff: Give the credit that would have increased your glory
          to someone else.
        %dt Impostor
        %dd
          The character lives in and for lies. Perhaps he is proud of his ability to
          introduce and control illusions into the lives of people he uses as tools. 1xp:
          Pass yourself off as something you’re not. 2xp: Lie to yourself or your
          friends. 5xp: Your lie survives a concerned effort to debunk it. Buyoff:
          Confess to your victims.
        %dt Mission (specify)
        %dd
          The character has an important mission that they must complete. Unlike the KEY
          OF THE VOW, this Key concerns a clear task with a finite end-point. 1xp: Try to
          forward your mission. 2xp: Succeed towards your mission. 5xp: Reach an
          important waypoint. Buyoff: Abandon the mission.
        %dt Outcast (specify)
        %dd
          The character has lost fellowship in a group or organization, becoming an
          outcast. This has not necessarily lessened the hold the organization’s values
          have on the character. 1xp: Your status as outcast comes up. 2xp: Interact with
          the organization. 5xp: Work against the organization. Buyoff: Rejoin the
          organization.
        %dt Past
        %dd
          The character has a dark, significant past. 1xp: Your past comes up. 3xp: Your
          past influences a decision. Buyoff: Make a different choice this time.
        %dt Power
        %dd
          The character hungers for control, perhaps because he’s had so little of it.
          1xp: Struggle for influence. 3xp: Improve your social position. Buyoff:
          Relinquish your position.
        %dt Relation (specify)
        %dd
          The character has an important relationship to another. Familial relationships
          are the simplest, but fraternity is also universal. Sometimes other
          relationships develop as well. 1xp: Interact with your relation. 2xp: Follow
          the other’s advice. 5xp: Defend your relation from danger. Buyoff: Sever the
          relationship.
        %dt Servant (specify)
        %dd
          The character serves another due to fealty, money, force or other concerns.
          There are some cultures in Near that do not recognize servitude, but most do.
          1xp: Obey the master. 2xp: Suffer in service. 5xp: Save the master in some
          manner. Buyoff: Leave service.
        %dt Suffering
        %dd
          The character belongs in a disenfranchised population, born (or at least
          adopted) to suffering. 1xp: Fail in your efforts. 2xp: Be abused by others.
          5xp: Fate casts you down. Buyoff: Succeed beyond your expectations.
        %dt Vengeance (specify)
        %dd
          The character thirsts for vengeance against a person or group that wronged
          them. 1xp: Express your hate and intent for vengeance. 3xp: Attack your target
          in word or deed. Buyoff: Let your enemy go when they are at your mercy.
        %dt Vow (specify)
        %dd
          The character has sworn an oath he intended to keep to his dying day. Unlike
          the KEY OF THE MISSION, this Key would concern an on-going, static commitment.
          1xp: The vow comes up during play. 2xp: The vow causes significant difficulty
          for you. 5xp: Another character tries and fails to make you break the vow.
          Buyoff: Break your vow.

    %a#equipment-fruits-of-culture{:name => "equipment-fruits-of-culture"} Equipment: Fruits of Culture
  %p
    “Equipment” in the SOLAR SYSTEM is a somewhat flexible term: not only tools and
    gear, but also masses of people, vehicles and natural weapons have been
    considered equipment. The dramatic significance of equipment in the fiction is
    its external nature to the character himself; we’ve chosen to emphasize this by
    giving equipment separate, distinctive rules. They can be used to emphasize
    realistic considerations (“having a sword against an unarmed man is a big
    deal”) or for purely dramatic purposes (“this particular sword symbolizes
    kingship, therefore it has mechanical impact”), as desired.
  %p
    Equipment more than most other rules has a somewhat problematic history in
    TSoY. The original equipment rules of the game have not interacted too well
    with my own play: at first I spent a couple of years outright misplaying
    against the intent of the rules, and when I corrected my understanding, it
    proved that the rules didn’t fit the bonus dice heavy crunch environment at my
    table.
  %p
    My intent with these new rules was to build them to be essentially compatible
    with the old ones, to make it easier for individual groups to pick and choose
    their own preferred approach.

      %a#basics-of-equipment{:name => "basics-of-equipment"} Basics of Equipment
    %p
      When a character has an important tool, such as a signature weapon, the player
      may choose to have it emphasized via the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT. The Solar System
      rules for DECLARED equipment may also be used if desired.
    %p
      Each piece of equipment has a QUALITY VALUE as an Effect; this is derived with
      a Barter (I) or suitable crafting Ability check, depending on how the character
      came by the equipment. The quality is important when another character is
      trying to destroy the equipment, and it sets the upper limit for the
      equipment’s usefulness in other ways as well.
    %p
      The two main mechanics for a piece of equipment are EQUIPMENT RATINGS and
      IMBUEMENTS. A given piece of equipment will usually have equipment ratings
      equal to its quality rating; it may also have at most that many imbuements.
      However, each imbuement increases the INTRODUCTION COST of the equipment, so
      having them is not always a good thing.

        %a#mundane-vs-magical-equipment{:name => "mundane-vs-magical-equipment"} Mundane vs. Magical Equipment
      %p
        This has not been so much of an issue in other settings, but in TSoY I seem to
        constantly bump on the matter of unrealistic equipment: a character might have
        a comb that helps him attract horses, or some such unlikely combination. The
        fantastic environment seems to encourage this, as in fact it is perfectly
        possible to have such a comb in this game.
      %p
        The way I deal with this is to be clear on whether equipment and its ratings
        are mundane or “magical”, and judge accordingly. It’s perfectly reasonable for
        a character to buy a horse that helps him move faster, but buying a horse that
        helps him write letters would take a bit more doing, because normally I would
        assume that such horses weren’t for sale in most places.
      %p
        Mundanity is judged mostly by the Story Guide. Usually it comes up when a
        perfectly ordinary smith wants to create some strange and wonderful device.
        That’s when I get to consider whether such a creation really is possible
        without Elven magic or some such source of supernatural mojo. Some groups will
        specifically want to make fantastic equipment easy to create, so do by all
        means draw the line between mundane and magical as you see fit.

        Some crunch only applies to equipment used in different ways. These are not
        classifications of equipment itself, but of how it is used. A TOOL is any
        equipment not used against an opponent. A WEAPON is an equipment used
        offensively to affect an opponent, while an ARMOR is used to protect oneself.

    %p
      The equipment rating is a value in the range +1–3, combined with a short phrase
      describing where it might be applicable.
    %p
      For example, a simple sword might have an equipment rating “+1 to injure men or
      beasts”. This sword would then be applicable when the character using it tried
      to injure men or beasts with it.
    %p
      Each equipment rating is associated with a different scope of effect: higher
      ratings come only from more specialized equipment, like so:

      %li A telescope for a +1 when examining distant things.
      %li The Book of Light for a +1 when convincing people.

    %p
    %dl.docutils
      %dt +2 rating
      %dd
        only applies in specific circumstances, akin in scope to the SECRET OF
        SPECIALTY. Examples:
    %p
    %ul.simple
      %li A firebomb for +2 at burning a thing.
      %li An Ammeni perfume for a +2 in convincing people attracted to you.
      %li Snowshoes for a +2 when traveling over snow and ice.
    %dl.docutils
      %dt +3 rating
      %dd
        applies in very specific circumstances that rarely come up of their own
        accord. Examples:
    %p
    %ul.simple
      %li A helmet for a +3 against head-blows.
      %li A royal charter for a +3 when convincing people to go along with it.
      %li A shallow boat for a +3 when traveling in the Zaru marshes.
    %p
    %p Each equipment may have at most three +1 ratings, two +2 ratings and one +3 rating, provided the equipment quality suffices. Most likely these ratings overlap in one piece of equipment, providing increasing specialties within a single field of endeavor, but that is not mandatory.
    .section
      %h4
        %a#using-equipment-ratings{:name => "using-equipment-ratings"} Using Equipment Ratings
      %p
        Despite being a bit lengthy thing to explain, equipment ratings are useful
        because they can be hooked into other crunch to provide different effects. They
        also have one basic use that is available to anybody with an equipment rating
        at hand: should the character make an Ability check in a situation where the
        rating applies, the player may opt to replace the check result with the value
        of the equipment rating. The dice roll simply doesn’t apply, although it is
        rolled normally. The only cost of this is that if the check would have been a
        FAILURE (0) without the equipment, then the equipment’s quality quality drops
        by one.
      %p
        To make this unequivocal: the equipment rating replaces the result of the
        check, and does not care about the character’s Ability level. It’s not far off
        to say that the character is withdrawing from the conflict and letting his
        equipment do the struggling, whereas he merely makes an Ability check to see if
        he can keep the equipment from breaking.

        The default effect of equipment ratings isn’t cumulative, but if a character
        has some crunch that makes several pieces of equipment sensible, then I allow
        each individual piece of equipment to be used once per check as long as the
        action makes sense in the fiction. The Story Guide might wish to lean on
        traditional fantasy RPG aesthetics in this, with single-handed and two-handed
        weapons, shields and such.

    %p
      IMBUED items are a lateral depiction of equipment. They are items with
      integrated Secrets in them that a character can use through the item.
      Imbuements are useful in depicting not only wacky magic items that do stuff for
      you, but also for mundane equipment that does more than just improves Ability
      checks. A character might, for example, have a heavy mace with the SECRET OF
      KNOCKBACK inherent to it, to coin a mundane example.
    %p
      Existence of Imbuements does not increase the Advance cost to own an item;
      instead, an imbued item has an INTRODUCTION cost: first time the item is used
      for anything in a single scene, the player has to pay a Pool cost equal to the
      number of imbuements it has. This goes even if the item is just used for its
      ratings; the presence of imbuements makes taking the item out a weighty matter.
    %p
      Which Pools the imbued item drains is established by the Story Guide when the
      item is introduced; the profile remains unchanged after that. Be colorful about
      it: heavy anime weapons take Vigor, items with many parts take Reason, that
      sort of thing. An item’s quality rating sets the maximum number of imbuements
      an item may have.
    %p
      Although the imbued Secret is used just like it would if the character himself
      possessed it, Pool costs and all, in the fiction it is usually not the “same”
      Secret that people use. Thus imbued Secrets don’t care about fulfilling
      requirements, can’t be used to learn the original Secret and so on. When I
      particularly want to emphasize that I’m not talking about a natural Secret that
      characters learn, I call imbued Secrets IMBUEMENTS. So an imbued mace doesn’t
      strictly speaking have the SECRET OF KNOCKBACK, it has KNOCKBACK IMBUEMENT. One
      other difference between Imbuements and Secrets is that the former are usually
      somewhat narrower in application: the character has to use the item in question
      to activate the Imbuement, for example, while the Secret version can be used in
      any situation.

      %a#gaining-equipment{:name => "gaining-equipment"} Gaining Equipment
    %p
      The simplest method for gaining equipment is to DECLARE it. Aside from Story
      Guide decision á la SOLAR SYSTEM, players may purchase the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT
      all but instantly by deciding that a character’s horse or armor or hat is
      important enough to pay an Advance for. Most Story Guides seem to be fine with
      this; I myself used to be hardass and demand a character to go buy or steal or
      otherwise gain a piece of equipment interesting enough for this, but nowadays
      I’ve come around: if equipment has been established as existing in the fiction
      and it’s not in the middle of a conflict, it’s the player’s decision where he
      wants to spend his Advances.
    %p
      When the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT is spontaneously declared like this, have the
      player make a suitable Ability check to represent the quality of the item, in
      case such a check hasn’t already been made. If no pertinent Ability jumps out,
      the Story Guide may well decide the quality of the item freely: the item would
      probably be between MARGINAL (1) and GREAT (3), but it’s the Story Guide’s
      call. The equipment ratings for garnered equipment are determined by having the
      player first pick one equipment rating, after which the Story Guide names the
      others based on his sensibilities. Declared equipment is always “mundane” in
      the aforementioned sense, I’d expect.

        Rated and/or imbued equipment costs an Advance to own. It is not uncommon for
        characters to go to Advance debt with suddenly garnered equipment while they
        gather experience to learn to use it properly.
      %p
        Losing equipment allows a character to regain the Advance invested in it. This
        goes for gifts as well: giving a piece of equipment to another regains an
        Advance for the giver, while the receiver has to invest an Advance.

      %p
        Characters with suitable Abilities can create equipment by declaring it, as per
        above. There are also Secrets that make the process more efficient, such as the
        SECRET OF CREATION. Imbued items are complex enough that I don’t usually allow
        creating them by declaration at all, unless the imbuement makes very much
        sense.

        %a#disarming-and-destroying-equipment{:name => "disarming-and-destroying-equipment"} Disarming and destroying equipment
      %p
        Whether a character can use a piece of equipment depends on the fictional
        situation, so one way to prevent it is to disarm him with suitable action.
        Also, the equipment may be outright destroyed just like if it was an Effect; an
        Ability check against the quality of the item suffices.
      %p
        Equipment that loses in quality also loses equipment ratings, and might lose
        imbuements if the quality drops low enough. The user of the equipment chooses
        which ratings and imbuements are lost. The ratings can be regained by repairing
        the equipment with a suitable check; the imbuements only come back in repair if
        that seems to make sense in the fiction; otherwise they need to be recreated
        from scratch.

          %dt Secret of Equipment (specify)
          %dd
            The character owns a piece of rated or imbued equipment. The Effect rating of
            the equipment is a free Effect with no upkeep, although fixing the equipment
            (rerolling the Effect rating) costs normally.
          %dt Secret of Creation (Ability)
          %dd
            The character is skilled in equipment creation using a particular Ability.
            When he creates rated mundane equipment, the player gets to choose all of its
            ratings. The player may also imbue the item with mundane Secrets, and determine
            its introduction cost profile. Cost: VIGOR per item’s quality, 2 REASON per
            imbuement.
          %dt Secret of Equipment Mastery
          %dd
            The player can consume a ‘+’ overflow die to activate an applicable equipment
            rating: the rating acts at a level one step higher than normal for this check.
            Secret of Weapon Mastery
            The player can consume a ‘+’ overflow die to activate an applicable weapon
            rating: the opponent’s check suffers penalty dice equal to the rating.
          %dt Secret of Armor Mastery
          %dd
            The player can consume a ‘+’ overflow die to activate an applicable armor
            rating: an incoming Harm is reduced by the value of the rating.
          %dt Secret of Tool Mastery
          %dd
            The player can consume a ‘+’ overflow die to activate an applicable tool
            rating: he immediately gains the rating in pool points usable freely as bonus
            dice or in activating Secrets. If not used, the points become a free Effect.
          %dt Secret of Overflow Control
          %dd
            The player can use empty ‘ ‘ overflow dice in lieu of ‘+’ dice when activating
            his Secrets.
          %dt Name Imbuement
          %dd
            The item has a name, it’s unique and famous. The character may call out the
            name when introducing the item to pay the item’s introduction cost out of
            suitable Effects related to the item.
          %dt Expert Imbuement (Ability)
          %dd
            The item is complex and difficult to use. The character using it has to
            succeed in the chosen Ability check when introducing it. The introduction cost
            is reduced by the check result, but failure damages the item’s quality by one.
          %dt Null-rate Imbuement
          %dd
            The item is not broadly useful, and does not have ratings. Instead its
            introduction cost is halved, round down.
          %dt Secret of Signature Equipment
          %dd
            (specify) A piece of equipment the character owns is particularly important to
            him. Reduce the introduction cost of the item by two points when he is using it
            himself.
          %dt Secret of Shattering (Ability)
          %dd
            The character can destroy equipment and other material Effects with particular
            fluency when using the chosen Ability. In normal conflict his check result is
            deducted from the Effect’s value even if he lost against it; in extended
            conflict he can pay Pool associated with the Ability to increase damage he
            causes to an Effect.
          %dt A Simple Sword
          %dd
            This sword’s quality rating is GREAT (3), so we might consider it a masterwork
            weapon. It’s the sort that might be used in Maldor or Goren. Ratings: +2
            against other swords. +1 for fighting against people. +1 for fighting animals.
          %dt My Amazing (4) Warhorse
          %dd
            A horse wouldn’t necessarily be equipment, it could be just a color element or
            a character in its own right. Making it equipment emphasizes that it is
            essentially furniture when the character is not using it. This trained horse
            provides a discount to its introduction cost with a CAVALRY (V) check. It can
            trample others with the SECRET OF MIGHTY BLOW. It can also see spirits and
            associates INSTINCT with CAVALRY (V), perhaps due to its northern stock.
            Ratings: +3 for charging in formation. +2 against infantry. +1 for fighting
            outdoors. +1 for traveling overland. Imbuements: Expert (Cavalry) (V) Mighty
            Blow (V) Spirit Sight (I) Retrain (Cavalry, Instinct) Cost: 2 VIGOR and 2
            INSTINCT per scene, minus the Expert deduction. The introduction cost is not
            paid for merely having the horse in the scene, but even using the ratings
            triggers it.
