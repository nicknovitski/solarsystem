  %p
    This movement centers upon the dominant northern power in Near, the Houses of
    Ammeni. These vicious corporations have shed all morality in their own fear of
    death and lust for living. The theme is slavery and colonialism, as all the
    wrong hands work to knit the world together.
  %p
    Many peoples adjoin the Ammeni lands, and all have to suffer to some degree:
    the Zaru have been all but decimated as a nation, brought into utter abasement
    as slaves to the insatiable Ammeni. Khalean tribes wage a fatiguing war against
    their would-be Ammeni conquerors. Even the distant Qek is being brought to heel
    by colonists greedy for gems and cocoa.
  %p
    The people of Ammeni stand on the brink of destiny in more ways than one, but
    whether that destiny spells downfall to their order or the beginnings of a new
    Empire nobody seems to know.

      Ammeni is a sensual land of beauty and death, a place where human perceptions
      are overpowered by the strong spices, garish fabrics, power and helplessness.
      The land and the people answer powerfully to instincts of lust and hate, they
      are shaped by it all.
    %p
      “Ammeni” is the land ruled by the Houses of Ammeni, seven mercantile entities
      of immense influence. They are the only law in the land, their traditions the
      only values people believe in. Theirs is a poisonous influence that marks the
      people to the bone. Ammeni lands reach from the Sea of Teeth to the eastern
      coasts, making them a linchpin of trade for all of northern Near. The original
      plantations are mostly scattered along the River of Vipers, their bases of
      power extending all over the Zaru delta. Ventures of Ammeni reach far to the
      south, and with the war into the lands of Khale as well.

      %p
        Ammeni, being incredibly hot and wet, is extremely fertile. The majority of the
        Houses' business is growing rice and fruits and farming fish and water buffalo.
        These staples, plus the chilies grown further in the west, provide them with an
        endless source of trade. Their navy is powerful and is used for shipping, not
        only for Ammeni, but to allied merchants in Maldor, where it makes a tidy
        profit on the deal. Ammeni is also home to Near's most wondrous drugs and
        deadliest poisons. A career in death is definitely a lucrative one here. The
        items Ammeni is most deficient in, yet craves, are metals and jewels. Most of
        their trade is for these two goods.
      %p
        Power in Ammeni comes from the seven Houses, plantations which have grown into
        both tremendous mercantile houses and governmental entities. The “House” refers
        not only to the ruler of the House, or the business, but also the land that
        House controls. Within a House, laws are determined by the ruler of that House
        or his staff, and are usually capriciously enforced. Trade law is created by
        majority vote among the rulers of the seven Houses, the Council, which are
        normally embroiled in the covert sabotage and annexation of each other, forming
        alliances that last only weeks before backstabbing tears them apart.

          %dd
            Ammeni knowledge of bodily functions is the most extensive of the nations of
            Near. This Ability can be used for surgery, torture and bizarre piercing arts
            sometimes inflicted on decorative servants. Practitioners tend to be respected
            and wellpaid craftsmen.

            The art of silent, sudden death. The Ability is not so much concerned with
            martial skill as it is with a compartmentalized mind necessary for cold-blooded
            killing. An encyclopedic knowledge of the instruments of murder follows. Use
            this Ability for any exotic, pre-meditated killing, such as leaking poison into
            a sleeping person’s mouth via a string.
          %dt Bladework (I)
          %dd
            This Ability is used for all sorts of intricate knife skills from tricks to
            fighting to crafts. It is typical to both high and low classes in Ammeni, where
            men display bravado with knives and women are expected to hide their protective
            blades intimately. The Ability may support in many sorts of social, craft and
            violent situations and even be the main Ability of a focused turning-point.
          %dt Sex (I)
          %dd
            Ammeni culture takes sex somewhat seriously as a craft and art form. Practice
            is not entirely egalitarian; women, especially house slaves and professional
            entertainers, are expected to be better at it. The Ability is useful
            accompaniment for CHARM (I) in seduction, and in general usable as a sort of
            artistic and knowledge Ability related to sexual performance, reproduction
            biology and sexual hygiene. Despite their purposeful sensuality, Ammeni are no
            smarter than others over what sex means; expression ranges all over the place,
            even more so than in less sensual cultures.
          %dt Dance (I)
          %dd
            Others may know how to dance, but the Ammeni entertainers are the best there
            is. The Ability is useful as an artistic thing, which, as we know, means that
            the player needs to make it useful by playing towards that sort of content.
          %dt Bamboo Warrior (V)
          %dd
            Most weapons and armor in the metal-poor Ammeni are made of bamboo, a
            flexible, common material in the area. This Ability is good for creating
            weapons and armor out of bamboo, as well as using polearms and such made of the
            light material effectively. Originally this was a peasant art of defense, but
            today independent peasants are few and bamboo is cut for professional soldiers.
          %dt Secret of Kata Nei
          %dd
            Kata Nei is a bamboo fighting style mostly favored by high-class Ammeni. It
            utilizes improvised weapons, preferentially untreated bamboo stalks, which the
            fighter cuts and splinters into nasty instruments during the fight. The
            character gains bonus dice to his BAMBOO WARRIOR (V) checks in a fight by
            breaking his weapons: each expended bamboo stalk gains one die, to a maximum of
            two (one for each hand) per check. Replacing the weapons mid-fight ranges from
            trivial (i.e. in a bamboo forest) to impossible; in extended conflict it
            requires either advance preparations or a defensive round spent in procuring
            replacements.
          %dt Secret of Bamboo Mercenary
          %dd
            Most mercenary officers in Ammeni are from Maldor, but half of the men are
            locals as well. Those units that cannot afford metal arms are forced to adapt
            to native conditions. The character with this Secret can use MELEE (V) and
            BAMBOO WARRIOR (V) interchangeably.
          %dt Secret of Healing
          %dd
            When the character is healing another with an Ability check, he can make an
            Effect off the result. As long as he maintains the Effect, the target character
            heals one Harm under the Effect level for every scene of bed rest. However, if
            the patient acts against the Effect’s recovery instructions, he suffers the
            Effect level as Harm as his wounds reopen.
          %dt Secret of Ritual Dance (specify)
          %dd
            The character has learned a specific, complex dancing performance purported to
            have wondrous power. If any character declares that a Secret his character
            possesses would be greatly supported by the preternatural qualities of this
            particular dance, this will be so: not only can the dancer support the Secret
            in action, but he can also share his Pool points with the user of the Secret.
            The player should keep a list of the Secrets that have been associated with the
            dance under this Secret. Cost: the other character pays REASON equal to the
            number of Secrets aided by this particular dance before adding his.

        Ammenites are known outside their country for their cruelty and decadence. The
        appearance is misleading, however: only the richest of Ammenites have the
        opportunity for cruelty and the ability for decadence. The rest of them are
        merely opportunists, making the best deals they can in a colonial society. The
        upper class of Ammenites, however, are decadent to an extreme, clothing
        themselves in the finest silk and eating bizarre delicacies grown only in the
        fertile delta soil. Ammenites are the descendants of Maldor, although they do
        not like to be reminded of this fact. Their language is much like the language
        of Maldor, but is filled with pops and flecks in between words to convey
        connotation.

        A full five percent of the population of Ammeni belongs to the hyper-wealthy
        House families, although many of these are not related by blood. The habitual
        assassination of family members means that ambitious types may rise quickly.
        Slavery is common in Ammeni, and at least twenty-five percent of the population
        is made of slaves, many of them from the former nation of Zaru. The rest of the
        population are either what we would know as middle management – low-level
        employees assigned to control slaves and supervise menial labor – or poor
        freemen, who try to attract as little attention as possible, and often leave
        Ammeni to become wanderers or traders.

        The Ammenites collect art of other cultures more than they create their own:
        the acquisition of art is a hobby for the upper classes. Native Ammenite art is
        bizarre, focusing on themes of oppression and the inevitability of death. The
        most famous Ammenite painting is of a rice patty, red with blood, with tall
        stalks rising to the sky; the most famous book is the story of the last 24
        hours of a rich, mad man. Zaru slaves do create art as well, although mostly
        ritual chants made of gibberish that manages to convey emotion. Their funeral
        dirges are known to bring even the strongest Ammenites to tears, which brings
        horrible wrath upon them.
      %p
        The food of Ammeni, however, is considered a delicacy. Hot and spicy, full of
        cream, rice, and noodles, as well as odd ingredients such as slugs, uncooked
        quail eggs, and fish-eyes, it evokes either love or disgust in most people.
        They make a rice wine that is similar: either astounding or repulsive,
        depending on the taster, and they take large amounts of poiture, the pollen of
        a gleaming white flower that grows wild in the rice fields of Ammeni. Poiture
        puts people into a deep relaxed state much like slumber where the sense of time
        becomes elongated. The Ammenites eschew religion, worshipping only gold and
        riches. The Council of Houses has outlawed religious ceremonies in the land,
        although both the Zaru slaves and members of the Houses often participate in
        odd cults, especially the Revenant Cult.

        Ammeni are the ever-popular antagonists of Near. In fact, their greatest theme
        in my eyes is redemption: how might this culture be justified or cured? Much of
        my original work on Ammeni in the following chapters revolves around this
        theme.
      %p
        Ammeni makes a very good milieu for steamy, passionate stories of human folly,
        sex and violence. This sort of story, called a BLOOD OPERA, is very good as a
        first introduction to the game for a group that doesn’t want to work with an
        adventuring premise. A blood opera operates on the premise that player
        characters are set up from the beginning to have clear, passionate goals that
        conflict with each other and those of other characters in the setting; this is
        very easy and natural in Ammeni, perhaps contributing to its popularity.

          Ammeni characters and stories set in Ammeni can go to some very dark places.
          The rules on conflict propriety from the SOLAR SYSTEM are important in defining
          the LINES that will not be crossed in the game content, as is common sense
          communication among the group; there’s no need to play awful events when they
          can be paraphrased in abstract, drawing a VEIL over the details.
        %p
          I have an important message for character players here, one that I often have
          to teach to new roleplayers: protagonism is not a guaranteed right, it can be
          lost. The easiest way to do so is to have your character act without
          understandable human motivation. In the immoral Ammeni it is easy for your
          character to trivialize the suffering of others; if you trivialize it as well,
          the other players will come to dislike the way you play and doubt your
          commitment to the fiction. They’ll try to play around it and take your
          character seriously, but if it seems that he’s just committing atrocities
          because you want attention or don’t care, it doesn’t come off very well.
        %p
          What the above means is: if your character does horrible things, you as the
          player should acknowledge it and accord the moment with the gravity it
          deserves. If the other players are taking the fiction seriously, they won’t
          like it if you don’t respect the endeavor equally.

        Ammeni is not, properly speaking, a nation; it is a cartel. It does not have
        citizens or nationals; even the individual Houses do not – they only have
        members.
      %p
        A member of a House is an interesting character because he or she might be
        steeped in cruelty, but still be a human being. How does that work? Is there a
        tension?
      %p
        The lower rungs of the House organizations have less and less stake in the
        endeavor that is Ammeni, thus making them more and more likely to have their
        own interests outside the House life. Or the middle-management might just be
        hungry and ambitious, ready to impress their masters by being even more
        ruthless than the next guy.
      %p
        Women of the Houses are usually very equal with the men, and twice as
        poisonous. The contrast is stark, as women in general are treated as property
        by the House scions.

        The Ammeni relationship with their slaves is an interesting topic, as it can
        range from pure victimization for gratification to uncaring practicality to a
        sort of internalized, natural partnership predicated on unequal rights. Pay

      From the fertile ground of Ammeni grows the world's largest supply of drugs of
      all types. Recreational drugs, poisons, and great healing herbs all sprout up
      wildly throughout Ammeni. The most common of these is a flower called POITURE.
      White poiture is a powerful recreational drug, sending the user in a hazy
      dream-state where consciousness becomes very third-person and the sense of time
      grows elongated. Red poiture, a much rarer type, causes fevered activity,
      occasional rage, and a loss of concentration. Black poiture is known to give a
      much more potent high than white poiture, and has reputed healing powers, but
      causes death in small quantities.

      Between the cornucopia of herbs and significant studies of the inner workings
      of the body done by curious or disturbed Ammenites, healers are common here.
      Many healers find employment in Houses as personal doctors or torturers, and

        The simplest way of creating poisons, drugs and cures is to engage HERBALISM
        (R) (or even WOODCRAFT (R) with the SECRET OF HERBAL MEDICINE) in a simple
        Ability check and make an Effect of the result according to the normal rules:
        assuming that the herbalist found the right herbs, the player gets to write the
        Effect as he would. Later the player gets to spend the Effect as bonus dice on
        appropriate checks, just like any Effects. Suitable Effects in this regard
        include such as “Various psychotropes from the hills” and “Fever-curing herbs”
        – give it enough detail to be interesting and make clear what the preparation
        actually does.

            properties of both rare and common herbs useful for food, poisons, drugs and
            cures. The practitioner may even try his hand at cultivating herbs in
            controlled conditions. WOODCRAFT (R) is simple and shallow in comparison, the

            Ammeni alchemy is a cynical science with little in the way of preconceptions
            and expectations; the alchemist rarely expects anything, in good or ill. He
            does, however, usually believe in the immortality of the body, achievable by
            the enforced balance of bodily forces. This combination of passion and cold
            calculation has driven Ammeni alchemy to great heights among the adepts.
          %dt Cooking (I)
          %dd
            Ammeni are superb cooks, thanks to the rich array of spices and exotic
            ingredients their lands supply. While HOUSEWORK (R) may make tasty food,
            Cooking is a superior art. Of course, it is not a given that tasty food will be
            much of an issue in a given campaign. Cooking may also be used to deliver
            herbal and alchemical poisons orally.

            Ammeni learn to distinguish poisons and drugs by sight, smell and taste,
            which is useful in a land infested by dangerous plants and animals. The Ability
            might be used in creating and trading drugs, but most valued it is in avoiding
            poisoning. Normally a character would support his ENDURANCE (V) check against
            poison with this Ability, to see how much he imbibed before noticing the
            poison.

            The character knows how to create INFUSIONS, powerful alchemical concoctions.
            The alchemist pays a REASON cost for his infusion when it is created. Complex
            infusions take great skill to create: each stage past the first incurs a

            failure ruins it. Each moved or removed stage causes a penalty die to this
            check. The funneling process may also be used to reverse engineer and master an
            infusion from another alchemist’s notes, although the Story Guide may mess with
            the exact composition and order of the stages during the process. Cost: 1

            (which they really aren’t). Often their effects are delayed by digestion

            no maintenance cost.
          %dt Secret of Addiction (specify)
          %dd
            The character is addicted to the specified substance and will have trouble
            doing well unless satisfied regularly. The addiction affects one of the
            character’s Pools, causing normal Pool refreshment to return only one Pool
            point for the character. A full refill, instead, is gained by partaking of the
            addiction. However, this only works once per session, extra satisfaction only
            returns one Pool point per scene. (For multiple addictions in one Pool, all
            have to be satisfied for full satisfaction, but each can be satisfied
            independently for partial.) Addiction can be broken by long-term denial and
            RESIST (R) check, but the Secret remains and becomes active if the character
            ever indulges again; only extraordinary measures (a QUEST, say) can remove an
            addiction altogether.

        ALCHEMY (R) is an alternative for this simple Effect-work: it is inferior in
        that it requires more expensive equipment and ingredients to get the same
        outcome, but for more complex work alchemy is mandatory: aside from the SECRET
        OF BOTANY simple natural cures cannot be leveraged much further. Alchemy can
        use mineral and animal materials as well as plants to work on, although Ammeni
        alchemy is traditionally almost exclusively based on Flora.
      %p
        When a herbal Effect is used in a hostile way, the victim is of course entitled
        to declaring a conflict. This might be a simple ENDURANCE (V) check against the
        poisoner’s ASSASSINATION (I) or COOKING (I), depending on how the poison is
        applied, with the Effect value as bonus dice for the poisoner. Normal conflict
        resolution in that regard.
      %p
        The next step in alchemy is distilling INFUSIONS, which is possible with the
        SECRET OF THE STILL. An infusion (the effective pharmaceutical substance
        suspended in a liquid such as grain alcohol) is also an Effect, but it is not
        normally consumed as bonus dice: instead, it represents the potency of the
        special formula the alchemist produces. When infusions are created, the
        alchemist creates one or more STAGES of the infusion, all of which may have
        different mechanical effects on the target. The first stage in Ammeni alchemy
        is always created with HERBALISM (R), while the other stages are normally
        created with ALCHEMY (R); the player makes the appropriate Ability checks for
        each stage in a support chain. Should a stage fail, the whole concoction is
        ruined. The alchemist may opt to end the process at any stage, or continue to
        make the infusion even more powerful.
      %p
        For each successful stage in the distillation process, one STAGE EFFECT from
        the following list is chosen; the Story Guide chooses the first stage according
        to dramatic coordination; afterwards the player (or players, if several are
        involved) and the Story Guide take turns, with the Story Guide messing or
        cooperating with the process as he would. Depending on the details of the
        process and the available resources of the alchemist, individual stages may
        have to be delayed to procure some special tools or materials (or even replaced
        by checks of TRADE ROUTES (R), WEALTH (R) or BARTER (I)); the Story Guide
        interprets the fictional details as necessary. The player may also freely delay
        the work for refreshment or do other things on the side, provided he keeps
        notes of the progress.

          %li
            Harm might be caused by all infusions, but with this stage effect the amount
            is greater: the infusion causes its full value as Harm instead of the check
            difference. Even when successfully resisted, the infusion causes its Effect
            value minus the check difference in Harm.
          %li
            Unconsciousness causes the recipient to go into a daze or outright coma. This

            Heighten or dull senses causes the stage of the effect in bonus or penalty
            dice to Ability checks based on a particular sense, or allows the character
            to perceive otherwise indiscernible things. The bonus dice may turn into
            penalty dice with unexpected stimulation, such as bright sunlight or loud
            noise.
          %li
            Addiction is a common effect, often introduced by the Story Guide into
            appropriate drugs. The recipient of the drug makes an ENDURANCE (V) check
            against the Effect value; on failure he pays the stage of the effect in Reason
            or takes the appropriate SECRET OF ADDICTION.
        %p
          The player gives a name to the completed infusion, creates an Effect (for free)
          out of the last Ability check in the process and writes down the stage effects
          in order. The overall outcome looks somewhat like the examples to the right.
        %p
          When an infusion is applied (orally or injected), the target makes an ENDURANCE
          (V) check against the Effect: on a success last stages of the Effect equal to
          the check difference do not activate, while on failure all stages activate and
          the character suffers the check difference as Harm. On a tie, obviously, all
          stages take effect and no Harm is caused.
        %p
          The infusion Effect is not particularly consumed by using it (unless using the
          FRAGILE EFFECTS variant rule, of course); the Effect represents the on-going
          efforts of the alchemist in creating and preserving his stock of the infusion.
          The Effect may be destroyed by divesting the alchemist of his stock, notes and
          tools, using normal rules for destroying Effects. The Effect may not be
          directly duplicated by another character per se, but the alchemists can of
          course help each other reproduce experiments.

          When infusions are used in conflict, sometimes the issue is not whether the
          character can endure the horrid poison, but whether it is successfully injected
          in the first place. My take on this is that I don’t necessarily allow the
          victim a conflict over the issue; a character needs to be aware of the
          possibility of poison, otherwise it is a simple unopposed check of
          ASSASSINATION (I) or some other Ability for the poisoner to slip it to him. An
          aware target may often use REACT (I) or a more elaborate Ability to avoid the
          spray, needle, or whatever implement the poisoner would use.

        opportunities and costs of expanding alchemy – what it takes to become

          %dd
            The character has learned a new stage effect to include in his infusions:
            Healing infusions still may cause Harm, but they also hasten recovery from
            appropriate Harm. Remove one Harm of at most the Effect level of the infusion.
            A healing stage may only occur on stages divisible by three.
      %p
        That last part is a bit frivolous, but I’m demonstrating a technique: a stage
        effect may be limited to appearing only at certain stages of the infusion to
        make life difficult for alchemists. Another thing to do with the stages is to
        tie the strength of the effect to the stage it appears on. This forces the
        alchemist to choose between an easily endured powerful effect and a more
        reliable, but weaker one.

        create a drug that does the same thing by combining UNCONSCIOUSNESS and
        HEIGHTENING SENSES; a creative reading makes applying crunch exciting, which is
        good, because that’s where the fun is supposed to be.

            wealth might be specific or ever-changing, depending on the character. Any
            material Effects he chooses to garner by wealth come to him effortlessly,
            without Pool cost. Similarly, he pays a Pool point instead of an Advance to
            wield mundane equipment that can be bought. The only limitations to this are
            practical, such as time and availability; the Story Guide might consider one
            application per scene a good rule of thumb on this. The Ability used in the
            procurement of Effects and equipment is WEALTH (R), unless the task is left to
            a suitably skilled client. The character still pays Effect upkeep on refreshes
            for any Effects he chooses to maintain, and he has to invest the Advance to
            keep any equipment at the end of the session. Cost: 1 VIGOR to use mundane

        The Ammeni plantation industry is predicated on cheap human labor. They do not
        hesitate to enslave new peoples when opportunity arises, and they encourage
        their stock to breed in captivity to increase the wealth. Bred slaves are
        prized, and the institution certainly has its painful and uncomfortable
        moments: Ammeni culture as a whole does not have an over-arching legal theory
        for slavery, so often a person’s status as a slave or a free man is a matter of
        opinion, resolved by the people present and how they view the claimant to
        freedom: deeds of ownership are usually honored by the Houses, as well as
        brands and other such marks, but lacking those leaves the putative slave-owner
        with little but his own strength to enforce his claim. Only Zaru, goblins and
        similar distinctive subject peoples are presumed slaves without further proof;
        the only issue with them is finding the legal owner.
      %p
        It is important to distinguish that while slaves often have little mechanical
        impact to what happens in individual scenes of the game, this is not because
        they do not have individuality, value or purpose as human beings to us; rather,
        we deal with a bunch of plantation slaves exactly the way we would deal with a
        bunch of guardsmen or free peasants or nobility at a soiree: as extras who
        don’t have direct impact on this particular story as long as we choose not to
        look closer.
      %p
        Specifically, when the SECRET OF SLAVERY says that slaves always perform with
        MEDIOCRE (0) Ability when conflicting for their master, this is not to say that
        slaves in the setting are always non-remarkable in every way; rather, the
        relationship of the slave to his master deprotagonizes him when it comes to the
        master’s goals. The same slave might turn around and act as a MASTER (3) in the
        very same scene, should he have reason to act for himself as a human being
        instead of as a tool for another.

        Ammeni law is set by the Council of Houses first and foremost to facilitate
        trade. Although some other things are touched upon when the Houses act in
        agreement, trade is the common priority. What’s more, the authority of the
        Council in this role is accepted with surprising sincerity by the Ammeni: free
        traders do not lightly renege on a fair deal between unencumbered traders, even
        as the cynical princes of the Houses follow the law as a convenience only.
      %p
        Ammeni trade law makes clear distinction between House trade and independent
        speculative endeavors; the differentiation is essential, because the
        preferential trade clauses commonly used in treating with trade partners are
        only enforceable in House trade; meanwhile independent trade is free from
        having to defend stapling and market rights from falling to disuse. In practice
        this arrangement means that while internal and well-established trade routes in
        Ammeni are carefully allotted as House monopolies by precedent and their
        ability to demonstrably service the trade, the same Houses compete with the
        most adventurous independent merchants when it comes to speculative trade.
      %p
        Ammeni trade law divides trade privileges conceptually into MARKET RIGHTS and
        ROUTE RIGHTS. The former concern rights connected to local control of
        territory: for example, the right of House trading depots to inspect and delay
        travel through the depot, most often situated in a waterway access of some
        sort. This might also involve rights of first offer or mandatory market
        participation by any merchants passing through the depot. In Ammeni lands only
        Houses hold market rights, while elsewhere Ammeni traders have to negotiate for
        these rights with the local rulers; typically a House trader would set up an
        enclave within an existing settlement or start a new trade station in the area
        after negotiating for exclusive rights to conducting the local market. Such
        rights would then be enforced against other traders with the help of the local
        ruler. It is entirely conceivable for an Ammeni trade master of this sort to
        eclipse the wealth and authority of whatever local ruler his position depends
        on.
      %p
        Route rights are involved in a different way, as they range from trade secrets
        to legally enforced monopolies. A speculative trade route increases in value
        greatly after it has been proved feasible by successful exploration. At this
        point the route does not have any protection aside from obscurity. However, a
        House that conducts regular trade along a specific trade route and improves it
        with waystation arrangements may in time claim ownership over it; such
        ownership over an abstract trade route is not legally enforceable against
        foreigners, but the Houses themselves do not compete on routes claimed by other
        Houses in this manner. Independent Ammeni traders might or might not respect
        route claims; if caught, however, they lose negotiation privileges for right of
        passage and trade in the lands and markets of the particular House, which would
        often be a crippling blow for an independent trader: all Houses hold
        established steadings on the Poison River, which any may bar against trade at
        their own cut-off point.
      %p
        The Ammeni trade law is in many ways orthogonal to old civil law of the Empire,
        and in many ways its direct opposite. This is no constraint to the Ammeni
        traders, who follow their own laws in their own land and no law at all anywhere
        else, unless forced to it by a local power.

        the Empire.
      %p
        That’s the socialistic narrative, anyway: merchant princes wield enormous
        power, which is counteracted by human decency. The alternative reading is that
        the soft power wielded by traders in the post-Shadow Near is by its nature
        cooperative and egalitarian, opposed to feudal arrangements of Maldor. It is a
        way for the world to find itself without conquest.

        Either way, it is a good idea to tie merchant characters and their business
        onto issues of human identity; the character is easy to leave shallow if his
        only driving force is to succeed in his trade endeavor for no particular
        reason. The background is important: is he a member of a House, knowing that
        the pride of his parents ride on his success? Is his caravan backed by his

      Zaru is a land broken and divided. Set in a delta at the eastern mouth of the
      Poison River, she has been conquered by Ammeni, her people enslaved. The only
      resistance are outcasts, people not welcome in the Zaru communities or worship
      halls, for they have committed the worst sin of all, the taking of human life,
      and discovered a dark knowledge the elders cannot bear.
    %p
      Zaru was once rich. Her soil is extremely fertile and rice, swamp apples, and
      other crops grow bountifully. Zaru's greatest asset became her downfall,
      though: the language of ZU, the language of creation, spread beyond her borders
      and infected the world. Zu is not like other languages; it is magical, and
      anyone hearing it can then use it themselves. Moreover, speaking it actually
      wills actions, circumstances, and objects into being.
    %p
      Because of zu's ability to infect others' minds, the Maldorite Emperor Absolon
      used it to cement his empire by making it the universal language of his people.
      When the knowledge of zu spread, the people of the world misused it, not
      understanding its power. Many people believe the use of it caused the great Sky

        After the Moon rose, Zu became broken. Now the people long used to peace had no
        means of defending themselves. By nature, the Zaru are pacifists, finding no
        need for violence with their terrible gifts. As they emerged back into the
        world, they found themselves overpowered by the Ammenites, who had long before
        envied the fertility of the Zaru delta. Zaru's people were taken as slaves and
        made to work in the worst sort of hot, steamy, swampy conditions.
      %p
        As a people, the Zaru are fairly uniform in appearance. Black hair is virtually
        homogenous among them, and their skin is dusky, their eyes dark. If they look
        like a modern-day people of Earth, those people would come straight out of
        Southeast Asia, complete with loose-fitting clothes and large, flat hats made
        to keep the burning sun off them when toiling in the fields.
      %p
        As a nation, Zaru does not exist any more. Ammeni truly has dominated it, and
        Zaru villages exist on Ammenite plantations, under the care of foremen. Typical
        construction is made of bamboo, and communities exist around “speaking halls,”
        long buildings in which the Zaru eat, cook, converse, and often sleep. Only the
        elders of a community and their adult children have the privilege of living in
        tiny huts built around the speaking hall. Older villages, pre-Shadow, do exist
        in Zaru, which are basically larger versions of their slave villages: large
        speaking halls with family houses built around the central building. These are
        usually constructed of hard, baked clay around a bamboo center, and are
        incredibly durable. As insurgency has grown in Zaru, some radical groups have
        fled to the old towns and formed their bases of operations there.
      %p
        Families are very important in traditional Zaru culture. They are viewed as
        “mini-villages,” with the eldest person being the leader of that family.
        (Pre-Shadow Zaru houses bear this out, as they are usually built as a long room
        spanning the house, with small rooms for the elders built off of this.)
        Villages are built around the same structure, with the eldest person in village
        taking the role of priest and leader, as they have seen more and heard more
        than anyone else. The Ammenites are well aware of this, and break up families
        and villages by sending children inland and working the elderly to an early
        death. One underground movement in Zaru returns babies to their mothers in the
        dark night, traveling far over land to switch them back.

        with stories about when zu was taken away, agree that it should not be used,
        thereby keeping it firmly - but uselessly – in Zaru hands. The younger
        generation doesn't completely agree: there is a strong underground movement to
        rebel against the Ammenites using any means necessary.

        Killers and especially the radical MOONMEN priesthood are called
        “blood-thieves”. It is not just that they are willing to spill blood; the
        actions of the radical freedom fighters reverberate in the world and cause
        outsiders to bring violence to Zaru villages. Elders consider this a crime just
        as much as having blood on your own hands.

      %p
        Non-aggression and pacifism are fundamental cornerstones of the Zaru existence.
        They are also what binds the people to their servitude and makes them the
        preferred slave stock for their Ammeni masters.
      %p
        Resistance comes in a multitude of forms: for example, the priesthood of Hanish
        has released a martial art for the slaves, called UPTENBO or
        “life-shield-hand”. It is non-lethal but powerful, concentrating on redirection
        of force and incapacitation of the opponent. Uptenbo is not just a martial art,
        but a philosophy that strives to teach the frustrated Zaru to turn their
        weakness into a non-violent strength on the face of the enslaver. It is taught
        secretly, disguised as dance.
      %p
        A martial art such as Uptenbo consists of a number of TECHNIQUES. Techniques
        are just Secrets that are further referenced by other Secrets, such as the
        PUMSA, intensively trained fighting combinations that strive to overcome an
        enemy without giving him a chance to react. The opponent of a pumsa can break
        the sequence by preventing the character from performing the next technique,
        which might be done by various means, but at least a REACT (I) check to dodge
        whatever the opposing fighter is doing should work. Pumsa are normally used in
        extended conflict over several rounds, but a smart group can apply them
        feasibly in other mechanical contexts as well.
      %p
        (Although I don’t usually term fighting techniques from other cultures as such,
        they are still TECHNIQUES in the mechanical sense. Feel free to experiment.)
      %p
        The philosophy of pacifism is rooted deep in the culture of Uptenbo, the
        masters of which believe in not only the moral superiority of non-violence, but
        its actual strategic superiority: one day they will free Zaru by demonstrating
        to the conqueror that the people will not, cannot be swayed to cooperate any
        longer. Whatever happens then, the land will once again be free.

            Uptenbo is the underground Zaru martial art. Because of the traditional
            non-violence of the Zaru, Uptenbo is purely a defensive art, and can be used to
            drive off, humiliate, or subdue an enemy, not to kill. It consists of strong
            locks, throws and sweeps, using the enemy's attacks against her.

            The character has learned to move continuously, without breaking for thought.
            In extended conflict his UPTENBO (I) action counts for both bonus dice and Harm

          %dd
            The character has learned to give way against greater strength and make the
            best of his loss. When losing an Ability check with UPTENBO (I), the character
            may convert the winning check into penalty dice for himself instead of
            suffering the default outcome. The dice are held by the opponent and allocated
            to further checks the character makes as long as the situation continues. A
            normal conflict is pre-empted by this technique as if a tie, but it may be
            reattempted by either side. In extended conflict the character may force the
            penalty die pool to disappear by taking a Defensive Action. Cost: 1 INSTINCT

          %dd
            The character has learned to prepare his mind for the non-violent combat
            method. Meditation is depicted by UPTENBO (I) Effects such as “I am ready to
            oppose the Master”, for example. Instead of spending such an Effect as bonus
            dice, this Technique allows the player to swap a pertinent Ability check with

            When he does, instead of humbling or subduing, the attack breaks bones or
            organs and kills.

        %a#id8{:name => "id8"} Actual Play
      %p
        An important Story Guiding principle for a solidly slavery-focused campaign is
        this: do not take the institution of slavery, in farming or personal servitude,
        as a standardized proposition to which all characters should have easy
        snap-shot judgments prepared. Life doesn’t work that way.
      %p
        The above is important for the idea I’ve already floated earlier: the Story
        Guide should engage in enabling play. Thus, when a player tells you that his
        character is going to steal away and go explore inside the master’s villa to
        find that girl he took a fancy on, the correct response is not “of course all
        slaves are branded or memorized by face or watched by foremen all the time,
        that’s what it means to be a slave, right?” Rather, consider the opposite
        reality in your judgment: for the slave economy to function at all, there must
        be a certain degree of participation and cooperation, however enforced, from
        the slave population. This in turn means that a character willing to risk
        punishment might very well have a considerable freedom of action on his side,
        at least until he is noticed as a troublemaker by the foreman.
      %p
        To choose another tack, consider the Ammeni slave masters and their attitudes.
        It would be easy to presume that for them to uphold the institution of slavery
        at all, they’ll all have to be remorseless monsters that will of course never
        care a bit about what a slave has to say. A more moderate (and again, more
        realistic) viewpoint is to presume that many Ammeni are not directly exposed to
        the more savage facets of their economy, and thus are emotionally utterly
        unprepared to face the reality. For this sort of character it is far from
        unlikely that a player character could influence them through pity, even if the
        player character happened to be a slave.
      %p
        What those examples are trying to say is, once again, simple: do not
        deprotagonize and disable player characters just because of your own
        preconceptions about how powerless they should be. Rely on the conflict
        resolution system to make these judgments for you.

    %p
      Zu is more than a language to the Zaru; it is also a religion. The beliefs of
      the Zaru people can best be described as “spiritual humanism.” They believe zu
      is the language that was used to create the world by the First Man, and that
      all humans are his descendants, all divine. When the first murder occurred, zu
      was corrupted, as murder is destruction, the antithesis of what humans were
      born to do.
    %p
      The Zaru have always seen themselves as the caretakers of zu, keeping it pure
      in the face of a fallen world. Hanish, the Zaru that traveled to King Absolon
      and helped stop the Sky Fire, changed the nature of zu with his final chant,
      altering the path of the Zaru forever.

        There are several priestly organizations loosely forming in Zaru, all centered
        on proper zu usage and Zaru unity. One group believes that all Zu should be
        kept firmly in the hands of Zaru, specifically elders, thereby keeping the
        unwise from using it, and denying their enemies a potent weapon. This group,
        the WATCHERS, train young rebels to work as “word-horses”, adventurers who
        steal zu from non-Zaru, or Zaru using it unwisely, and bring those zu back to
        their priests. This group is committed to the Zaru way of non-violence, but
        some fringe sects have seen fit to use foreign mercenaries to carry words.
      %p
        The SONS OF HANISH follow a more moderate path. They seek to follow Hanish and
        be an active force in the world, while staying true to their beliefs. This
        group operates in cells, which are based on the family “mini-village”
        structure, and attempts to change the situation of the Zaru by subtle actions,
        like using zu to influence a foreman to keep a family together, or causing a
        crop to do well or poorly.
      %p
        The MOONMEN are the most radical of the Zaru priesthoods, and are the most
        diverse. While the Sons of Hanish are mainly young and male, and the Watchers
        older, the Moonmen are made up of brash youngsters, lunatic elderly, calm
        mothers, and even foreigners. They advocate nothing more than a full unleashing
        of Zaru power. Nonviolence is taken only on a personal basis among them, and
        they have no real structure. Instead, individual Moonmen tend to upset the
        cart, often putting the community in a worse situation, and spread their
        beliefs among those pressured enough to listen. It is said that the Moonmen
        count among their ranks at least one elf and several goblins. More conservative
        Zaru call these “blood-thieves”, both for their subversion of the normal Zaru
        structure, and for their willingness to kill.

        What of Zu, then? It is a language with a relatively simple structure, easy to
        learn even after it has become broken. However, the same simplicity breeds
        ambiguity, making mastering zu a task for a lifetime. Zu is made up of discrete
        syllables, each with a generalized meaning. These syllables are also words;
        complex ideas are built by combining several. Syllables each have three
        meanings, based on tone:
      %ul.simple
        %li Nouns have mid-tone, or no tone.
        %li Verbs have low tone.
        %li Modifiers have high tone.
      %p
        The syllables, depending on tone, mean each of these things; thus no syllable
        exists in zu that cannot be used as a noun, verb, and modifier. Pronouns are
        implied by context and body language. Some examples of syllables:

        Sentences, as modern-day speakers think of them, exist by combining syllables.
        The last syllable used in a sentence conveys the mode. A sentence ending in a
        noun is a statement of fact, meaning “this exists” or “this is so”. A sentence
        ending in a verb is a command, even if it refers to the speaker: the speaker is
        stating her action and in essence, commanding herself. A sentence ending in a
        modifier is optative: it expresses hope or desire for change, meaning “I wish
        that it was like this”.
      %p
        As mentioned, syllables are for general terms, not specific. There is no one
        syllable for “tiger”, for example. “Tiger” would be spoken as
        “knife-tooth-hunter-beast”. Another example would be “sword”, which is said as
        “killing-knife”. If a zu speaker does not use multiple syllables to be
        specific, then the most appropriate meaning is assumed. For example, if a
        speaker says “beast” in a forest, he means “forest animal”; if he were to say
        the same syllable in a snake pit, he means snake. If he were to say “knife” to
        a farmer and a hunter, he would again mean different things – most likely a
        scythe and a hunting knife.
      %p
        There is one syllable in zu that is not like any other: “zu”. “Zu” is an
        affirmation, an agreement. Originally, there was no opposite, no “no” in zu.
        (True Zaru never speak in the negative: if there is nothing affirmative to say,
        they do not speak in zu.) With the first act of murder, however, that changed.
        The murderer, the destroyer, lost his ability to speak the syllable “zu.”
        Instead, he spoke the syllable “uz” a word of disagreement and destruction. No
        person can say both “zu” and “uz”.

        Originally, anyone who spoke zu could use it as words of power. Stating that
        something was so made it so; commanding someone compelled them; wishing for
        different circumstances brought them into being. With Hanish's final chant,
        this changed. He brought all the power of zu into himself, recreating himself
        as the First Man. Suddenly, the Zaru lost their power, as their language became
        ordinary and impotent.
      %p
        Hanish died that day, but the power of zu did not die with him. Instead, it
        changed forever. The power of a syllable could be harnessed, but only by one
        person at a time. Anyone who studies zu can speak it, but only those who are
        the master of a syllable can use it to enforce their will. Now, Zaru priests,
        outcasts, and foreigners vie to obtain the knowledge of these words.
      %p
        The words of power are first awakened within a person when he hears them used:
        the SECRET OF ZU (or UZ) is learned only when the words are uttered in a
        character’s presence. Some grasp it at once, some never, to some it comes
        against their will. The danger of using zu around other people is that they may
        steal the knowledge of a syllable. When a word is uttered, anyone who hears it
        can engage the speaker in a battle of wills to own the knowledge of that word.
        Only ZU (and again, UZ) itself may be mastered by all.
      %p
        Mechanically speaking, anyone with an Advance to spend (two Advances if they
        lack the SECRET OF ZU) may engage an immediate conflict of ZU (R) against ZU
        (R) to wrest the word from its current owner when it is uttered. Should the
        transference succeed, the owner regains an Advance while the thief pays for the
        word.
      %p
        Words may also be given willingly, in which case no Advances are spent or
        recovered. In all other ways Zu syllables are handled as Secrets.

        When a character with the SECRET OF ZU and some mastered syllables uses the
        power, the mechanical effect depends on the mode of the utterance:

          A noun utterance wills things into being. The player spends a point of REASON
          for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (R) check. Anybody else present
          reflexively RESISTS (R) the event (creating support chains if they want).
          Should the speaker succeed (nobody resists successfully, rather), the thing
          summoned appears nearby. If animate, the summoned thing is not under any
          particular control of the summoner.

          A verb utterance is a command, forcing the target to obey. The player spends a
          point of INSTINCT for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (I) check. The
          target may RESIST (R) freely, and in any case the command only works if the
          target can hear the speaker. (Understanding the language is not an issue, words
          of power are always understood by all.) Impossible tasks may not be compelled,
          and the player of the target interprets the command. Long-lasting tasks only
          continue for several scenes if the character makes an Effect off the check
          result.

          The utterance of a modifier changes circumstances of action. Modifiers may
          affect both people and things, both positively and negatively. The player
          spends a point of VIGOR for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (V) check. The
          result of the check is used as either bonus or penalty dice towards any targets
          that are affected, or optionally turned into an Effect if the change in
          circumstance is lasting. The intended influence of the utterance need not be
          direct: a wind exhorted to blow faster may cause penalty dice to fall on the
          captain of a ship, for example.
        %p
          Note how the associated Pool of ZU changes depending on the mode of the
          utterance. The Ability checks made to utter a word may suffer conditional
          penalties assigned by the Story Guide normally; Zu is more difficult when
          large-scale changes are invoked, so summoning large things (or many things),
          commanding many people or changing circumstances in a wide area is more
          difficult.
        %p
          Ambiguity of utterances plays a key role in Zu – the players know what
          individual syllables roughly mean, but when words are invoked for power, the
          Story Guide always judges the actual outcome of the utterance based on the
          context, word-play and dramatic coordination. Thus the syllable “cat” serves
          just fine when the character just wants a feline, but if he needs a big and
          dangerous predator, then “fang-cat” or “big-cat” or even “big-fang-cat” is much
          better. Getting some actual control over the invocation is pretty much the only
          reason to ever pay more than one Pool point for a single Zu invocation.
        %p
          As for Story Guide judgment, in actual play I’m usually not too hard-ass about
          zu. It is a power that is fundamentally not controlled by its invoker, and may
          thus turn against him, but outright adverse effects should be saved for when an
          alternate reading of the uttering is either really funny or more obvious than
          what the player intended. If the players make a point of using 2-3 syllables on
          important invocations instead of trying to get by too cheaply, the Story Guide
          is doing fine. Think of it like interpreting wish spells in DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS:
          it’s most fun when both the invoker and the Story Guide take the word-play with
          flair and understand that the magic the character is using is an unruly beast.

        Traditionally lists of zu don’t provide the actual syllables, only the
        translations we use. This book doesn’t use many zu syllables; UP, TEN and BO
        are probably the most prominent after ZU itself. This does not mean that we
        don’t use made-up syllables in actual play; we certainly do, it’s just that we
        establish whatever syllables we want when and if they’re needed.
      %p
        I’ve included a long list of suitable zu words here because it’s something
        people tend to ask after when it comes to actual play. Thinking up words can be
        hard, but just like all other contents in this book, don’t let my words
        constrain you: your zu can be different, or it might be that zu includes many
        ways of structuring the same concept. Just because I might connect
        \&lt;person|speak|humane&gt; doesn’t mean you can’t use &lt;person|love|passionate&gt;, or
        even both words. The important thing is for you to choose the small set of
        syllables that you actually use in your campaign to reflect your own
        understanding of the primal society and culture of Zaru. Presumably the things
        easiest to express (individual syllables) are also those that reflect the state
        of creation as spoken by the First Man.
      %p
        Note that while the players invent Zu words, characters are limited by the
        language itself. Sometimes there just is no word for something in zu, the
        language of creation.

      Across the Border Sea, the deep green peninsula of Khale is an echo of Qek's
      lushness. Once a stone's throw across the Hungry River from Qek, the
      earthquakes of the Time of Shadow have split it away as the river was ripped
      into the much larger Sea of Teeth. It is still close: the Dragon's Mouth is a
      small strait between Khale and Qek, and is usually much calmer than the sea.
      Controlling this strait, as well as a mysterious substance called moon-metal,
      earns Khale the enmity of its southern neighbor, Ammeni, who has attacked the
      country in a war of attrition for several years.
    %p
      The forests of Khale are wet and thick, but move from jungle to evergreen
      woodlands, dappled with sunlight. They are sacred to the people of Khale who
      live beneath their towering boughs. Everything a tribesman could need is found
      under the forest-top, from fields of mushrooms and plants for medicine and
      food, to deer to hunt and ride, to fallen tree limbs easily sap-cured into bows
      and spears. Before the Time of Shadow, great webbed cities connected the
      forest; since then, the remnants of tribes live only off the land.
    %p
      Khale is a harsh land in which to live: its many rivers flow with the blood of
      cousins, as the many tribes fight for control of their own land, and Ammeni
      pushes its troops further north. The land rumbles as many chieftains try to
      unite the tribes, but so far, none have been successful.

        Khaleans are a hearty and strong people, Mediterranean in appearance, with
        generally black, brown, or red hair, and green or brown eyes. They claim
        ancient heritage with the people of Qek and maintain good relations with the
        few Qek that emerge from the jungle, although they speak different languages.
      %p
        Khaleans operate in tribes of two to ten dozen people and consider all tribe
        members to be their family, not just blood relations. In fact, blood brothers
        from different tribes are not considered to be related at all, except in the
        way that all Khaleans are related. Upon marriage, males join the tribe of their
        wife, becoming part of a new family.
      %p
        In addition, outsiders, or those with no family, can become part of the tribe
        through a naming ritual.
      %p
        Within the tribe, status is very important. While family lines are matriarchal,
        positions of power are dominated by men. The tribe's chief is almost always
        male, the husband of the eldest woman in the tribe, and his advisors, usually a
        bard and his most accomplished warrior, are also men. When two tribes battle,
        it is Khalean law – that is, tradition as old as Khale – that only the tribe's
        men can fight. If a woman were found to be fighting for a tribe, it would be a
        horrible disgrace, and that tribe would more than likely surrender the fight.

        The forests of Khale are worshiped as ancestors. Each tree in a tribe's
        territory is believed to be a fallen member of the tribe, born again as part of
        the land. An ancient and legendary tree in the center of Khale is said to be
        the great King Khale, a ruler that united all of the peninsula and lands
        beyond, and the father of all modern Khaleans.
      %p
        Religion revolves around festivals, gatherings where a tribe – or many friendly
        tribes – will gather for a many-day-long revelry and celebration of their past.
        All festivals have tellings of great tales about the ancestors, done ritually
        around a bonfire. These rituals are competitive as tribal priests or BARDS try
        to outdo each other with fantastic stories. The bards, part priest and part
        artist, are given a special place in Khalean culture, as they are immune to
        normal tribal conflicts. When two tribes clash, the bards of each tribe will
        meet to write down the story of the conflict, narrating it as the battle flows.
        Killing a bard is a criminal offense, and usually results in the death of the
        murderer.
      %p
        Magic is fully accepted in Khale, and fascinates most people. The bards of
        Khale, and foreign sorcerers (called DRUIDS by the Khaleans) are highly
        respected and use magic freely. It is said that each bard learns three PERFECT
        CHORDS in his lifetime; which three seems to reflect life experience in a
        profound manner. The chords are normal Secrets, except that obtaining them can
        be somewhat arduous: SECRET OF QUEST may be used to sidestep requirements.
        Musical effects may, of course, be RESISTED (R) by the audience at will.

      %p
        Inside the forests of Khale, there is another world, a mystic world. This is
        their greatest secret, and it is forbidden to share it with those not of the
        tribe. Ancient trees, those with a circumference greater than two men holding
        hands, can be used as a gateway into the GREEN WORLD.
      %p
        This Green World is a maze of pathways, some so small that one must crawl
        through them, and others large enough for five people to stand side-by-side.
        The walls of these caverns are growing wood, light and grainy, and glow with
        faint green light. When the Sky Fire came, many Khaleans moved into the Green
        World to escape, building cities inside its immense caverns. Those cities lie
        dead now, and are said to be haunted; gnarled trees grow throughout them, with
        human expressions twisted into their trunks.
      %p
        The Green World covers all of Khale, and can be used as a passageway to
        anywhere else in the land, provided there is a guide. When one ends up is less
        certain: while experienced travelers have little trouble, those who get lost in
        the Green World may find themselves exiting into another time entirely. Bards
        sometime use these passages to go to earlier times and talk to ancient
        ancestors, although no one has ever been able to travel within one hundred
        years before the Time of Shadow, or one year after it.
      %p
        Legends say that King Khale himself still wanders these halls, a large old man
        with a beard like moss, and hands like wood-knots. Supposedly, he or other
        great ancestors can guide you to any place and time within these halls, or
        grant you great boons, provided you perform a quest, usually a reenactment of a
        previous adventure of the ancestor. During festivals, tribes will sometimes
        send their greatest hero bands to perform a quest and grant them success over
        their enemies. As war envelopes Khale from the south, some tribes have moved
        completely into the Green World, leaving the land of Khale behind. Their great
        mistake lies in the fact that the Green World does not stand alone: it is
        formed of the forest of Khale, and as the forest falls, it grows dimmer and
        smaller.

          The Green World is difficult to traverse. My strategy is to handle it almost
          like the Qek jungle (chapter 14): a bard familiar with the terrain may well
          learn knots from the ancestors or even tie them himself, becoming a TSAFARI
          (known in Khale simply as questors). The pertinent Ability in the Green World
          is TREE-BOND (I). Typical knots would involve gateways into different places
          and times, important ancestors and waypoints of ancestral quests.
        %p
          Characters unfamiliar with the pathways may still check TREEBOND (I) to avoid
          danger and encounter friendly ancestors, as their instincts lead them. Just
          like the Qek jungles, getting lost is an invitation for the Story Guide to
          complicate things, not to end the story.

        Tribes are communal entities divided internally into MOIETIES or “skin groups”,
        sort of totemic factions named for common animals that are entangled with both
        means of production and procreation: while a person’s moiety does not directly
        determine their occupation, it does indicate his responsibility of oversight
        over the work of others in the commune. Moieties for individuals are determined
        based on the moieties of their parents as well as their gender; the foremost
        purpose is prevention of incest, which is achieved by strict taboos in
        determining which moieties are allowed to marry each other.
      %p
        Khale trades for metal tools with Qek, and their longships sail to southern
        Maldor to trade spices which do not grow in that colder climate. Many young
        Khalean men, bereft of family, have joined crews, even becoming pirates. The
        Wooden Sickle is a famous ship of pirate youth that has been the scourge of the
        Ammeni coastline.

        Khaleans have a taste for drink, and import beer from Maldor and Goren and wine

        which is smoked for mild hallucinatory and relaxing effects. This drug is said
        to bring out epic tales in heroes and increase sexual desire.

        After the Year of Shadow, a group of explorers found a forest like no other in

        piece of the Shadow Moon fell to earth. Whatever it is, it has taken root and
        grows in a parody of a natural forest.
      %p
        Moon-metal is easy to craft, and deadly sharp and strong. If heated over a
        fire, it responds to the user's wants to form itself into any metal object of
        superior quality. However, moon-metal severs the user's relationship with the
        Green World: merely touching moon-metal gains the character a circumstance
        penalty die for TREE-BOND (I), and routinely handling the stuff merits two. One
        cannot enter the Green World at all with any moon-metal upon their person.
      %p
        Moon-metal has a weakness for wood, it deforms like soft clay when clashing

      %p
        Near is not a very peaceful place, but nowhere does war burn as savage and
        bitter as it does in Khale today. The Ammeni Houses have almost all sent their
        mercenaries to Khale, many uniting their forces under one leadership in their
        hurry to subjugate the land.
      %p
        Reasons for the war are two-fold: The coastline of Khale controls the Hungry
        Mouth, making sailing between the Eastern Ocean and the Sea of Teeth a
        hazardous thing when even stopping for water can bring hostile barbarians out
        of the woods. The other reason is moonmetal, which Ammeni princes have
        witnessed and which they desire for themselves.
      %p
        Ammeni bamboo weapons are no match to what the Khalean warriors have, but their
        leadership has been tempered in the wars of Maldor, consisting of some of the
        most cunning and ambitious men to ever come out of that war-torn land. Ammeni
        troops group together, build fortifications, patrol the forest paths and guard
        the building of roads into the woods. They fight in closed formation, with
        harsh punishment to soldiers who endanger the unit by breaking discipline.
      %p
        Khaleans respond with guerrilla warfare, striking and then disappearing into
        the forest, refusing definitive engagement. The tribes that did have died to
        the man, with women taken as spoils after the men reveal the tribe’s location
        under torture. The tribes farther in the wilderness might have only heard
        stories of what is going on, but all Khaleans are family to a degree: they will
        all fight when the word reaches them.
      %p
        Khaleans do not have a regular army in this war; what they do have are HERO
        BANDS formed of the best warriors of many tribes. These were originally based
        on the lodge structure of moieties that tie tribes together, but today great
        heroes travel from tribe to tribe, initiating any able body into the war
        against the Ammeni. The hero bands are highly motivated and thoroughly skilled,
        and they are pretty much the only cultural structure the Khaleans have for
        bringing the war to the Ammeni; hero bands make long treks into areas under
        Ammeni control to strike at the enemy where they can.
      %p
        As the Ammeni supply lines grow longer and the war grinds to a halt, the
        princes are sure to bring in more weapons, whatever they need to pacify the
        land. Burning the forest and desecrating Khalean beliefs forces tribal forces
        into disunity or decisive confrontation. Three-Corner wizards, native Ammeni
        sorcerers and eclectics from Inselburg can name their price when the war
        reaches this point.
      %p
        Regardless, it’s the Ammeni mercenaries who gave this war its name, for many
        have died in the woods without warning. For most of the Khaleans it’s still not
        yet a single, unified war; when this changes and Khale rises as one, who knows
        what will happen.

            good for ambushes, attacking soft targets, avoiding decisive combat, false flag

            quality merely decreases by one step. A moonmetal item does not have a limit to
            the number of imbuements it may have, and imbuing it gains a discount of one
            point. However, the item suffers when striking wood, breaking like a normal
            item subjected to the same Ability check; this can be resisted reflexively

            spend unlimited VIGOR for bonus dice in LUNAR FORGING (R). The character cannot
            enter the Green World, however, and Harm caused to him by wooden weapons is
            AGGRAVATED, marked accordingly on the Harm track. Such Harm does not shake down

            The character can form an elite warband out of people who are united by
            purpose, tribal, family and moiety ties. Use GENEALOGY (R), STORY-TELL (R) or
            SPEAK (R) to unite the warband into a HERO BAND. Such a band is created like
            equipment as per the SECRET OF CREATION, with the PURPOSE IMBUEMENT
            automatically included. Hero Bands can also imbue Keys. A hero band can be used
            by any member as equipment, although they can be disarmed by separating the
            character from his peers. The hero band is quite difficult to destroy, as named
            characters are more likely to escape and regroup than get killed; attacking
            their sense of purpose and loyalty is much easier mechanically. Cost: as per

            A HERO BAND always has this imbuement, as they have a definite purpose to which
            they are created. Using it for other reasons is only possible if the character
            convinces the heroes to take the new mission. The character might also lose the
            support of the band if he insists on going against its purpose. On the other
            hand, band members can only be suborned by overcoming the band quality, and
            they’ll always return for the character if he’s lost to them.

      %p
        The basic function for Khale and Khaleans in the larger Near is that they are
        fantasy barbarians. In fact, they are my go-to barbarians in the setting: if
        the game is set in Maldor or wherever and I need barbarians, then the Khalean
        woods are in Maldor, or next to it, or there’s an off-shoot culture of Khaleans
        somewhere about there, never mind geography.
      %p
        Having a barbarian culture to deal with is a fine thing when you want to
        compare and contrast lifestyles. Khaleans are of course by-the-book fantasy
        barbarians, noble and harmonious, but that sort of thing can be played around
        if desired: the war makes jerks of everybody after they’ve hidden under a rock
        for a couple of months while waiting for the enemy to make an appearance.
      %p
        A specific challenge that certain sorts of groups might have to face is this:
        why play in Khale when you could be playing ORLANTHI in Glorantha? I don’t know
        how it came to be that way, but there sure are similarities. A cunning Story
        Guide might draw on the rich Gloranthan sources for inspiration here, I’d say.
        In fact, I recommend it: that whole heroquesting thing in the Green World has
        already been figured out three or four times in detail there, for example.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#id14{:name => "id14"} Ideas
      %p
        Khaleans are a very romantic culture, which translates to “good” in our fantasy
        literature sensibilities. Go along with that, it’s probably more worthwhile at
        first than undermining it: for instance, destroying or corrupting the poor,
        noble savages is going to be very, very tragic, regardless of which side player
        characters happen to be on.
      %p
        Alternatively, consider my Ammeni Wars campaign, in which the Worst War becomes
        regional as a hero band travels to Orania and wins the Senate of Kalderon to
        their side; even if victorious, the epic heroes are going to have a bitch of a
        time with the Ammeni reconstruction: what do you do with a nation like that?
      %p
        I have the impression that the Khalean capability for time travel has largely
        been neglected in practical play, possibly because it takes a campaign to such
        radical directions. Still, one day I’m going to play an assassin from the
        future, his only hope to kill the man who would sell his people to eternal
        slavery.
      %p
        Other basic directions to go here are the Celtic olden goldies, like shamed
        heroes cast out of their tribe, bards seeking their art in the oddest places,
        romantic troubles caused by the moietic taboos and so on.

        Khalean names are vaguely Celtic, of course. The moiety is more important than
        specific parentage for most purposes, so a typical name format in intertribal
        matters could be &lt;position&gt; &lt;first name&gt; of &lt;moiety&gt; in &lt;tribe&gt;. “Bard Nevins
        of Snake moiety in tribe Luthan”, for example. Alternatively, “Bard Nevins
        Snake-skin of tribe Luthan” has a nice ring as well.
      %p
        Additional bynames are added, but only for braggarts and people who actually
        make an appearance in bard songs, in which such are a matter of course.

    %p
      Qek is the northernmost known land in Near, and one of the most forbidding.
      Filled from coast to mountain with thick rain-forest and jungle, Qek is a place
      of mystery and legend. It is the borderlands of the world and the north coast
      of the Sea of Teeth.
    %p
      This hot jungle-land might well be left alone, were it not for the copious
      amounts of jewels found in its caves. There are no cities, no centers of
      civilization, only the smallest of villages along the coastline.
    %p
      The people of Qek live among the jungle in small family units. Short, thin, and
      brown, the Qek (as they call both themselves and their land) hunt wild birds,
      boars, and reptiles and gather wild fruits for their sustenance. The people of
      inner Qek are generally unknown to outsiders; the families along Qek's shores
      that live on fishing are the few that generally speak with non-Qek. The boats
      of these people are legendary - small one-man kayaks made of jungle wood that
      they use to surf on top of the waves of the Border Sea, easily outrunning any
      other ship.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#the-family-is-a-breathing-thing{:name => "the-family-is-a-breathing-thing"} The Family is a Breathing Thing
      %p
        The only real unit of people in Qek is the family. Families live together,
        carving out a small bit of land to call their own, although there's no real
        land ownership. Three generations usually live together: a husband and wife,
        some of their parents, and their children. Generally, as sons and daughters
        grow to maturity, they leave and form new family units; as one half of a couple
        dies of old age, the other will live with one of their children.
      %p
        Qek has no government, but each family unit is part of a larger family unit.
        Within the larger family unit, families defer to the family they grew up in
        when they meet. In distant relations, the older family is deferred to, although
        they often choose another to make decisions. There is no clan-type structure in
        Qek: there are no clumps of unrelated people at all.

        The Qek do trade with the people of Khale and the nomadic tribes of Oran,
        exchanging wild fruits and cocoa for tools of metal, which they do not have the
        craft to make themselves. In addition, Qek is known for its precious gems. The
        people of Qek find these stones useless except for tools (they tip their own
        spears with diamond, which slip through armor as if it were butter, for
        example) and they are often traded for goods or services. Men from other
        countries that do not respect the sanctity of Qek often attempt to sneak into
        the country and smuggle out gems and cocoa pods, although few return.
      %p
        Apart from outsiders, the people of Qek have to contend with the APES as well.
        Apes are these furry goblins that live in various places in the jungle and the
        more hospitable slopes of the Wound of Heaven mountains. The problem with apes
        is that the Qek do not understand their language, if they have any, so there is
        much unnecessary strife with the “jungle people”, as the Qek ironically call
        the beasts. As a matter of fact, many of the apes do not have a language at
        all: the Qek goblins run the gamut from human-intelligent to completely
        animallike, but generally speaking they are all content to gorge themselves on
        fruit, intelligent or not.

      %h3
        %a#stories-without-letters{:name => "stories-without-letters"} Stories Without Letters
      %p
        The Qek have no written language, at least not since the Year of Shadow.
        Because of this, their art revolves around painting and oral storytelling. A
        great majority of their art is utilitarian in nature: ornately carved spears
        and staffs; beautifully crafted clay jugs; shields painted with intricate
        camouflaging patterns. Without cities, traditional sculpture is almost unknown,
        although carved frescos in rock are relatively common, used to tell ancient
        stories.
      %p
        The music of Qek is unearthly, and most outsiders have a hard time appreciating
        it. Their language is made up of a multitude of hard consonants, which lends a
        guttural quality to it, whether spoken or sung. In addition, the music has no
        traditional rhythm, instead alternating between discordant rhythms frequently.
        While a large part of their music – all based around stories – is sung, it is
        sometimes accompanied by a CHURANG, a guitar like like instrument made of dried
        innards strung across a hollowed-out armadillo shell.
      %p
        Qek's jungles are full of succulent fruit and spices, and are used liberally to
        season their food. A speciality that has reached out to be eaten elsewhere in
        Near is wild boar glazed with mango and cocoa, a plant native only to Qek.
        Cocoa (in the modern day, chocolate) grows in huge pods within Qek's jungles,
        and is used to make a hallucinatory beverage called araka of dried cocoa pods,
        fermented bananas, and hot chilies.

        The people of Qek do not speak of religion: they worship no single entity nor
        have organized worship. They do, however, have a strong belief in the idea of
        spirits.
      %p
        Spirits have three forms, the ROHO, the SASHA, and the ZAMANI. The roho are the
        spirits of the living, the animus that gives them individuality and vitality.
        These are bound within the bodies of people, animals, and plants. People and
        animals have the strongest roho, while plants have the oldest roho.
      %p
        The sasha are the “living dead”. Those who have died that are personally
        remembered by those still alive are sasha. Memories from stories do not count:
        someone who met the person while alive must still live. These spirits have a
        will of their own and remember their name, and they are said to hover close to
        earth, watching those who knew them. Their will can be bent by changing the
        memories of their human tethers.
      %p
        The zamani are the true dead, those long dead and forgotten. They do not
        remember their name and their own will is the longing for final rest, in the
        oblivion above the earth.

        The jungles of Qek are basically impenetrable and largely unknown even to their
        inhabitants. The native Qek may however increase his chances in the wilds by
        listening to his parents and to the spirit of the terrain itself. Geographical
        knowledge is not codified in maps in the featureless jungle; instead, the
        people memorize and share long path-songs that list distinctive landmarks and
        other important knowledge about the lay of the land.
      %p
        The earth spirits are considered similar but distinct to spirits of living
        things. The two are connected, however: a person can sometimes perceive the
        land correctly, and by doing so, name it. The end-result is called a KNOT, or
        simply a “place”.
      %p
        Knots make up the geography of Qek, which is otherwise indistinct and
        homogenous to human eyes. Knots are connected by PATHS, which in turn limit
        AREAS; in this way the jungle gains a topography people can understand and
        perceive.

        some suggestions might be helpful, being how most Story Guides are used to

        places are sort of a big deal, but also simple to introduce.

        %a#id17{:name => "id17"} Actual Play
      %p
        The way I play it, Qek is all about the HEART OF DARKNESS. Even the natives are
        scared shitless by the jungle, which is quite foreboding, considering that Near
        does not know serious inhuman threats. Still, animals make believable
        antagonists, and the jungle can be difficult for other reasons, as we’ll see in
        the next chapter.
      %p
        The most difficult part of Qek play is getting a handle on minimalism, as far
        as the Story Guide is concerned. You need to accept that your story will tell
        about these seven or so people variously related to each other, and about the
        jungle, and about these crazy, lily-white (metaphorically speaking, although
        the highest class Ammeni are white) colonist/explorer/Ammenites who’ve set up a
        trading post on the coast.
      %p
        That trading post is important, because that’s how you get cultural interaction
        going. Qek has always been the most marginal of the lands of Near due to how a
        character from Qek is always the outsider. It’s even true to a degree in their
        land.

          Qek name things and places very simply, using descriptive language. It’s best
          if we do the same. They also have a tendency towards using the name of a person
          prominently for anything that person owns, lives in, uses or makes. So somebody
          might have “Chantica pottery”, or live in “Rimac place”.

      Some Qek need to leave their families and travel long distances for fare or
      necessity. Should they share their knowledge of the dangers and opportunities
      within the jungle, they become known as knotbinders, TSAFARI. Such travelers
      are highly respected even among strangers for their knowledge of the jungle and
      distant events.
    %p
      Game-wise I handle the jungles of Qek a bit differently from other places in
      Near: the jungle has no defined geography for my purposes, and I draw no
      traditional maps even for adventure-oriented play. Instead, the jungle
      geography consists of familiar places called KNOTS, connected by known paths
      into a web-like topology.
    .section

        %a#using-knots{:name => "using-knots"} Using Knots
      %p
        Knots are the ROHO of the land itself given form. A knot is a place in the
        jungle, wherein “place” comes into being by the perception and naming done by a
        person, the tsafari. Without tsafari there would be no knots, and the Qek would
        be as lost in their jungle as outsiders are when they try to penetrate it.
      %p
        Knots are connected to each other by PATHS, naturally enough; knowledge of
        these is essential as well. Paths limit different AREAS of the geography, which
        concept may also be used by knotwork Secrets.
      %p
        Knots themselves are simply Effects that describe the place they tie to: “Knot
        of Birdrock 3/R” might be a knot, as well as “Knot of the Death River 4/R”. A
        character can learn about a knot from another just by listening to their
        stories. The teacher’s STORYTELLING (R) check determines the Effect level for
        the pupil’s knot Effect – however, the pupil’s Effect can only get higher than
        the teacher’s if the two are on location at the knot. A character that already
        knows a knot may renew his knowledge by visiting the place and making a LOCAL
        (R) check.
      %p
        For knotting purposes we sometimes need to distinguish between “terrain” and
        ephemeral elements of a location. The Qek say that anything that has not left
        the knot since its creation is part of the terrain – even the people.
      %p
        Knots are created by tsafari – indeed, being able to knot a place is what makes
        a tsafari. A once knotted place cannot be reknotted without dissolving the
        existing knot, which of course destroys the Effect from any characters that’ve
        learned it. Knots dissolve naturally when the sasha of the knotting tsafari is
        forgotten.

          %a#travel-between-knots{:name => "travel-between-knots"} Travel between knots
        %p
          A character with a knot Effect can find their way to a nearby known knot with a
          simple LOCAL (R) check, even when lost. They can also use any paths between two
          known knots to travel without having to make an Ability check at all.
        %p
          Characters can also create new paths between known knots with LOCAL (R) checks.
          Keep track of known paths under the pertinent knots to remember how the knots
          connect together. Creating a new path is more difficult for knots that already
          have many paths and knots that seem like they should be far away from each
          other. A new path may not be created at all if the character’s known paths for
          the knot already number more than his knot rating for the knots in question.

          Tsafari can create knots outside Qek as well, but doing so requires gaining
          LOCAL (R) knowledge for the new area. For knotwork encompassing several areas,
          check all pertinent LOCAL (R) Abilities. It’s largely up to the tsafari how he
          parses the non-jungle roho; a single house might be a knot, or a single town
          might be one. This needs to be discovered in play.

        %a#getting-lost{:name => "getting-lost"} Getting Lost
      %p
        A pretty big part of this whole knot thing is what happens when characters get
        lost in the jungle. This happens when they fail their LOCAL (R) Ability checks;
        characters without pertinent knot knowledge get lost pretty much automatically
        when they leave the coast or other landmarks behind.
      %p
        Getting lost is like having a refresh scene in that it opens the door for the
        Story Guide to control where the game goes next. The character has only two
        choices: to WAIT or GO ON.
      %p
        A waiting character will encounter an interesting secondary character
        introduced by the Story Guide, probably by happenstance (dramatic coordination,
        that is): an animal, stranger, enemy, friend... a chance meeting that opens up
        new directions for the story.
      %p
        A character that continues wandering ends up at the most interesting knot
        currently available. Again, dramatic coordination – the jungle is featureless
        and nigh-endless, the Story Guide does not worry about where the character
        would “likely” end up.
      %p
        In a word: getting lost is losing control of story direction. It might also
        mean trouble: I typically have the lost character check WOODCRAFT (R) to see if
        the fatigue, disease or other fun things get to him while lost, causing some
        Harm and thus raising the tension for the next scene with people.

    %p
      %em Fluff from Clinton’s book. Crunch adapted from the same.
    %p
      Some Qek, through birth or training, find themselves walking the path of the
      WALOZI, or sorcerer. These people can speak to the dead, get rid of evil
      spirits, and even bind sasha and zamani to new bodies. The Qek are no strangers
      to magic, and do not fear it, but walozi cannot be part of any family once they
      contact their first spirit. They are ejected to live on their own.
    %p
      Walozi magic is worked through complex rituals that last anywhere from ten
      minutes to a full day and night. The rites gain much power from sympathetic
      magic, symbolism and other such considerations. The RITUALS themselves are
      normal Secrets, but they are only usable by awakened walozi.
    %p
      Conversing with roho and sasha is considered fine magic to use, and families
      will often consult walozi to contact their loved dead. Consorting with zamani,
      however, is dark magic, indeed, and any walozi known to do so is shunned. These
      necromancers will live deep within the jungle, performing their dark rites.
    %dl.docutils
      %dt Roho
      %dd
        %p.first
          A living person’s roho can be CONTACTED by the walozi, although this requires
          cooperation or restraining the target. The roho does not know anything the
          person wouldn’t know, but in cases of inner conflict, amnesia or other
          disturbance the roho might diverge from the person’s viewpoint. The player of
          the character plays the roho as well.
        %p
          Roho can also be SEVERED from the body to float in the air like a sasha. This
          leaves the body without will, barely alive. As long as the roho lives, the body
          will be sustained as well, but it will only act on the command of the sorcerer
          who severed the spirit. Obviously enough, this is considered a black art by the
          Qek.
        %p.last
          A severed roho may be CONTACTED, GIVEN FORM or BOUND back into his own body,
          just like a sasha.
      %dt Sasha
      %dd
        %p.first
          The living dead can be CONTACTED by the walozi. Much of the ritual concerns
          attracting the right person. The sasha decides freely what it wants to say.
        %p
          Sasha are normally invisible, but the walozi may GIVE IT FORM to allow it a
          spectral shape in the world. The sasha may still not directly interact with the
          material, but they may be seen and heard, which allows some Ability use. The
          appearance resembles the person when he was still alive.
        %p.last
          A sasha may be BOUND into its original body, returning it from the dead. The
          body needs to be either in good health or ritually prepared. A bound or
          spectral sasha may be SEVERED from the world, returning it to the aether.
      %dt Zamani
      %dd
        %p.first
          Zamani are best considered as a sort of ambient negative life force. A walozi
          working with them is not dealing with individuals so much as just nameless
          spirit matter he attracts from the upper atmosphere to give it form. While the
          sorcerer might believe in a specific spirit, for our purposes we might be
          discussing pouring wine into a decanter just as well.
        %p
          In their GIVEN FORM Zamani appear as withered, gaunt ghosts. They are faceless
          and nearly mindless. A zamani might claim a specific ancestry in between its
          wails of pain, but should you believe it?
        %p
          Zamani may be BOUND to a dead body, either fresh or ritually prepared. Any body
          will do, even an animal one.
        %p
          Zamani are naturally bitter and need to be CONTROLLED by the walozi; they wish
          nothing but to slay the sorcerer and return to death. A controlled zamani is
          forced to obey the sorcerer, however.
        %p.last Finally, a zamani may be SEVERED to return it back to whence it came.

        A sasha given form or bound to their body will be a shade of their former self,
        mechanically speaking: the Pools are halved and the Ability ranks are capped to
        the walozi’s contact ritual result, minus one. The number of Secrets and Keys
        combined is limited to the Ability check. However, an ULTIMATE (6) Ability
        check grants full restoration. A bound sasha acts like a living being, except
        that they will be automatically severed should they ever suffer MORTAL (6) Harm
        or worse.
      %p
        To make it explicit: player characters can be freely resurrected by these
        rules. I imagine that legends of the amazing skills of the walozi are known far
        to the south as well; all good fodder for epic storytelling.
      %p
        Zamani are much simpler to create: a normal zamani will have Advances equal to
        triple the success level of the Ability used to summon them, distributed in
        half by the player of the walozi and half by the Story Guide. Zamani cannot
        have Keys, and they may only have crunch allowed to animals (chapter 27). A
        zamani bound to a body is immediately severed when they suffer a MAJOR (4-5)
        Harm or worse.

      %a#the-idea-of-ammeni{:name => "the-idea-of-ammeni"} The Idea of Ammeni
    %p
      The most evil man to ever walk in Near created a nation. His name has been lost
      to history, the Ammeni call him simply “Father”. As the legend has it, Father
      lived in the age before the Skyfire; he was a patrician of Maldor, a man of
      influence and discretion.
    %p
      When the Skyfire first appeared in the sky, people were concerned. When the
      fire grew larger, Father ordered action. His clients labored to raise walls.
      His factors brought foodstuffs from all over the Empire. His extended family
      gathered from all corners to stand by him. When Skyfire grew large as sun,
      Father closed himself off from the chaos outside, withdrawing to his estates.
    %p
      The land shook and clouds of ash blackened everything as the Darkness came.
      This mattered not within Father’s estates: the thick stone walls of the low
      buildings were like a secure womb that shielded the people within. Even as the
      weeks turned to months and months to years, as ice crept in long spikes down
      the eaves, Father’s foresight held strong.
    %p
      When the sun rose again, Father was distrustful at first. His sons insisted,
      however: Father was the first to greet the Moon’s gentle rays over the river
      Lamia, turned serpentine by the wracked torture of the land.
    %p
      The lands were deserted and in chaos, pitiful people covered from the Moon and
      the rainbow sunsets. Father had stores and men in his service, and tools of
      steel. His sons were quick to act, the first plantations were cut out of the
      wilderness to bring new prosperity to the broken world.
    %p
      Father himself quickly faded to background as his sons took over. The estate
      houses were reinforced and thralls accepted on the plantations – people outside
      the Houses through the Darkness were wretched, and happy to suborn themselves
      to the Ammeni.
    %p
      Soon the seven Houses were established as great plantations that fed the whole
      river valley. The influence of the Houses reached towards the sea, through the
      delta. Therein lived former subject people of the Empire, weak and destitute,
      unable to govern themselves now that world had broken.
    %p
      With time Ammeni came to rule the lowlands and the coasts, even encroaching to
      the barbaric west all the way to the mighty Absolon’s Way. The Houses grew rich
      and mighty, but they never forgot Father who sheltered them through the
      Darkness.
    %p
      The story does not end there, however. While the Houses outlaw all forms of
      religion, preferring to worship wealth alone, in truth every real Ammeni knows
      it: Father yet lives and guides the fate of Ammeni from the shadows.
    %p
      The concrete form of this belief is the Revenant Cult, a secret society of
      alchemists and House nobility who strive to uncover Father’s secret – eternal
      life. They believe that Father leads the cult and will reveal his secret to
      those who prove worthy of it by extended study and faithful service.
    %p
      The Revenant Cult is arranged into a strict tree of mentor–student
      relationships, with higher-ranking members being allowed to recruit more
      students than lower ranks. The cult prefers Ammeni nobility, is open only to
      humans, and hates elves and their supposed immortality fiercely.
    %p
      Glancing at the highest echelons of the Revenant Cult, we find Saul Lenoir, a
      man who claims to speak for the House Father himself. Some in fact think that
      they are one and the same. Saul is impossibly old and has found an immortality
      of sorts in an alchemical mixture of araka and poiture. He does not age, even
      if his body would like to decay. This is not allowed, and Saul consumes a few
      pounds of human flesh every day to keep his ageless mien. One of his ultimate
      goals is to shed even this limitation and truly embrace eternity.
    %p
      Even while the Council sets trade law and the Houses each rule as they please
      in their own domains, the Revenant Cult works its will among the Ammeni. Saul
      fears nothing so much as contenders to his plans, so he works relentlessly to
      keep others from uncovering his secret. Even with the aid of the Revenant Cult
      this is a ceaseless work in a land obsessed with the pleasures of life and
      death.
    %p
      Meanwhile, the Ammeni have grown into their role as rulers. They are known
      outside their country for their cruelty and decadence. Even if only the rich
      five percent share of these vices, the rest as well have grown heartless and
      opportunist in a country built on poison. The upper class has no excuses for
      their excesses, finest silks and bizarre delicacies of the fertile delta when
      the chattel slaves are worked to death or killed for sport.
    %p
      Ammeni is a country predicated on expansive colonialism and exploitation of the
      weak. Its national myths are cruel lies. The budding maritime empire reaches to
      embrace the whole of the Sea of Teeth. If any one place in Near is in need of
      heroism, it is found on the banks of the Poison River.
