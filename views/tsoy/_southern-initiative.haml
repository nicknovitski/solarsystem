  %p
    This movement introduces the primitive southern Near, where the Empire’s grip
    never was very strong. The forces that reign here go by a different name. The
    theme is faith and destiny, as one eschatology is crushed and another church
    rises.
  %p
    The land of Goren has been split in twain by the Skyfire, and by a religious
    schism that divides the people into two camps. Meanwhile in Vulfland a crusade
    is flagging as a chosen people finds that the world is a much larger and more
    complex place than they ever believed possible.
  %p
    The south is a grim and forlorn place where human contact is not a given. The
    stories are small and personal, as everybody tries to fit in. If the world
    would be changed, it will have to happen on the side, almost unnoticed.

      %p
        Typical Ability SPECIALIZATIONS for Gorenites involve sheepherding, knowing
        the hills, building of stone and wood, digging the earth, working a specific
        metal, cursing, intimidation, different vices and virtues, sermonizing, quoting
        the Book of Light, fighting trolls, recognizing goblins, suppressing women,
        elevating women.
      %p
        Typical Pool CONDITIONING for Gorenites originates in mine work, hermitage,
        mortification of the flesh, integrating virtues.
      %p
        Typical Ability ENHANCEMENTS for Gorenites come from Sky God blessings, Goddess
        blessings, trollish trickery, foreign magic.
      %p
        Typical Ability SYNERGIES for Gorenites are virtues and aspects to practical
        abilities and craft abilities to each other.
      %p
        Typical Ability RETRAINING for Gorenites involve esoteric religious practices
        and expanding craft abilities.
      %p.last
        Typical EQUIPMENT for Gorenites is metal, the finest weapons and armor in Near.
        Also staffs, religious symbols, Book of Light, troll fetishes, Goddess
        fetishes, dwarven tools.
    %p
      The lands of Near are akin to a tilted plane running from the Roof of the World
      to the Eastern Sea. The highlands west of Maldor have always been a source of
      metals and men for the Empire. It never was easy, for the hills are not
      deserted: the Gorenite clans have resisted the western lords for as long as
      they can remember.
    %p
      Today the hill folk are a taciturn and confident bunch; the Empire has finally
      receded like a wave from the beach, leaving the forts and guild-towns of Goren
      behind. A renewed sense of purpose runs through a populace gripped by faith,
      inspiring them to greatness.
    %p
      The people of Goren after the Darkness are split in two by a cultural
      revolution: the Gorenite highlands have gone through a bloody war with inhuman
      trolls, resulting in the Sky God religion gaining an unprecedented influence
      among the disordered Gorenites. Meanwhile the Jošland Gorenites in the lands
      beyond the sea remain united to their old ways of life and worship of the
      Goddess and her multiple husbands.

      %p
        The society of Goren is focused on clan holds, fortresses built on sparse
        hilltops before the Year of Darkness. A Gorenite CLAN consists of the people
        loyal to the clan chief holding the fort, often of people descended from the
        survivors of Darkness who sheltered in that particular fort. No land ownership
        is implied; land is only owned insofar as a family has an ancestral,
        established right to its use, a right that lapses when the family abandons the
        farming, grazing, fishing, mining or other occupation they have on the land.
        Because clan membership is often hereditary while people are transient, it is
        not uncommon to have members of different clans live as neighbors all mixed
        together in the more fertile (and troubled) areas.
      %p
        As the movement of people makes all the more successful clans increasingly
        fragmented, the nature of the clans starts to resemble that of farming
        cooperatives or outright gangs: the common form of justice in Goren is to ask
        for your clansmen to aid you in extracting whatever refurbishment is possible
        when somebody has wronged you. Stories tell of the time of the JARLS who united
        the land against the Empire in the past and ruled with justice, but those days
        are long gone.
      %p
        When somebody is a member of a clan, it is said that he is BLOODED to that
        clan. In Goren, you can only have justice if you are blooded, or have a blooded
        clansman speak for yourself: STRANGERS have no credibility to their demands,
        unless they come armed and ready to fight like the Maldorites did. In towns
        this makes for an increasingly large underclass of people forced to desperate
        poverty; the more urbanized clansmen realize the advantage they have, and are
        resistant to change. In towns three fourths of the population might be
        “strangers”; in the hill country, only one in five or ten.
      %p
        In olden times newcomers were eased into the clans through the institution of
        THRALLHOOD, a sort of contract slavery that could end in initiation; the
        children of thralls would in any case be free clansmen without exception.
        Thrallhood could come about as an alternative to killing an enemy in combat or
        because an unblooded Gorenite had no other choice but to submit himself as
        thrall to another. Today the Sky God Faith forbids keeping thralls, however,
        which means that admittance to clans is all but impossible for those with no
        desirable skills or considerable wealth.

      %p
        In the pre-Skyfire era Gorenites were accomplished sailors and explorers who
        colonized much of the long coastline of the southern continent. It is unknown
        how long ago all this happened, but the Gorenite people on both coasts of the
        Southern Sea share modes of speech and dress, as well as means of living.
      %p
        The close connection between “Old Goren” and the colonies was severed by the
        Year of Shadow, and has been slow in being re-established. Some clans on both
        continents share mottos and insignia, but there are no chiefs wielding
        influence in both lands. The south continent Goren often refer to their land
        simply as “Goren” just like the northerners do, but the land has a separate
        name as well: the first colonists called it JOŠLAND.
      %p
        The environment and conditions of life are in many ways similar in Goren and
        Jošland: herding and farming are important to both, while Jošlanders are also
        accomplished fishermen. Trade is much more important for Old Goren, which
        produces much of the metals consumed by all of Near. Jošlanders trade as well,
        but they have a fierce reputation as pirates among the northern peoples. An
        Ammeni trader who didn’t stay to experience the savage skirmishes in Maldorian
        border marches would consider the Gorenites almost civilized in comparison.
      %p
        However, what really separates Jošland from Goren is how they experienced the
        Year of Shadow: while Jošland was sustained by its belief in the Goddess
        through the dark, and sustained its witchfolk in turn, Old Goren was decimated
        by trolls, underground-dwelling goblins that conquered the highlands during the
        darkness. The fate of Goren was changed when the cenobitic actions of the Sky
        God religion brought a new destiny to the people.
      %p
        The religious schism is not a large issue for common Gorenites on either side
        of the Ocean, especially as the two have been long separated, but as contact
        increases, the issue grows like a boil in between them. Witches from the old
        country have fled to Jošland, speaking of persecution; highlands saints of the
        Sky God faith have been attacked when they’ve traveled overseas.

      %p
        Old Goren is not a land of humans only: when the Year of Shadow receded and
        clans started out of their fortresses, the TROLLS were already there: goblins
        adapted to darkness, living in old mines from the times of the Empire,
        proliferated through the Shadow, laying claim to much of the lands people had
        felt their own.
      %p
        Goblins had always been rare in aboveground Goren, mostly stories of
        changelings and humaneating. The trolls were predatory and strong-willed,
        unwilling to relinquish their herds and heaths to humans hungry for land.
        Although solitary creatures, the trolls were strong; humans long secluded into
        their fortresses were weak.
      %p
        Stories of the troll age tell of great troll chiefs and their goblin courts.
        While clansmen are unwilling to discuss their ancient enemy in a neutral
        manner, many unblooded families of today descend from collaborators that worked
        with goblins through the early years and accepted their Trollish rulers.
        Understandably goblins have a pretty bad reputation in Goren, considering the
        long struggle the clans underwent to reclaim their lands. Often a lone troll
        would keep an entire valley in terror for a generation before moving out or
        being slain by COISTRELS, professional troll slayers.
      %p
        Today trolls are a receding phenomenon in the central parts of Goren. Skyclad
        trolls can still be encountered in the farther reaches, but most old trolls and
        the remains of their courts have withdrawn back below the earth, where they
        belong as far as coistrels are concerned.

          %dt Skirmishing (V)
          %dd
            All Gorenite men are to some degree fighters, but the best are usually fighting
            carls in direct service to their chief, or members of a town guild that hires
            out to those who need protection. In either case the carls are expected to be
            ready for immediate bloodshed at a moment’s notice, and be quick to charge and
            retreat in serious combat, following their leader’s cue. Carls fight with
            swords and axes, or spears when defending a position.
          %dt Secret of Berserking
          %dd
            A berserk fighter fights without care for his own safety. Gorenite carls know
            how to encourage this mental state. A berserk warrior feels no pain, and thus
            treats all of his Harm as one class less serious insofar as penalties go.
            Berserking characters can use only SKIRMISHING (V), BRAWLING (V) and similar
            Abilities, and can’t spend Pools other than Vigor. Ending the state suddenly
            requires a RESIST (R) check. Cost: 1 VIGOR
          %dt Mining (V)
          %dd
            Most of Near’s metals come from Old Goren, either sold by clans or taken by
            force when Lords of Maldor come calling. Nowadays Gorenites despise mining work
            for religious reasons, preferring to leave it to the unblooded. Having goblins
            infest the mines does not help, either. The Ability itself is useful not only
            for mining, but also for understanding and utilizing mine architecture in
            moving in mines, or even siege warfare.
          %dt Smithing (V)
          %dd
            Gorenite smiths are the best in the world due to the mineral wealth of the
            land. The Ability can be used to work all metals, making and repairing various
            tools. Either this or MINING (V) can be used to smelt ores into usable form.
          %dt Secret of the Forge
          %dd
            When the character is working on equipment at least partially SMITHED (V), he
            can choose to create the work (and pay the Pool costs for it) in several
            phases; each phase has to end with an Ability check made into an Effect;
            failure ruins the work so far. Additionally, the character can imbue any number
            of Secrets into the equipment he creates, not limited by quality. Cost: 1 extra
            Vigor for imbuements over quality. Requirement: ability to imbue equipment.
          %dt Troll-lore (R)
          %dd
            Most Gorenites have seen a goblin, or at least know someone who has. Few really
            know them, but some have made it their business to know and be prepared for
            them. This Ability is useful in figuring out a goblin’s adaptations and
            addictions, its likely mindset and habits. It’s psychic profiling for creatures
            Gorenites fear and hate.
          %dt Key of Vice (specify)
          %dd
            The character embraces a weakness of character as moral virtue, believing that
            it is of no consequence or even beneficial, contrary to societal expectations.
            Define the weakness. 1xp: The character indulges the vice. 3xp: Suffering is
            caused by the ways of the character. Buyoff: Renounce the vice.
          %dt Secret of Vice-Troll
          %dd
            A goblin who revels in his moral turpitude might in Goren become a vice-troll,
            a softspoken creature that is able to entice others to share his vices with
            CHARM (I). Those who fail to resist purchase the KEY OF VICE appropriate to the
            troll. Cost: 2 INSTINCT Requirement: be a goblin
          %dt Secret of Filth-Troll
          %dd
            A goblin who lives in the soil drainages of the closely built, unhygienic
            Gorenite towns might become a filth-troll, a creature that mends its scaly hide
            and survives almost everything. He may use his ADAPTATION (V) to heal his own
            Harm. Cost: 2 INSTINCT Requirement: be a goblin
          %dt Secret of Troll-slaying
          %dd
            Gorenite coistrels have studied goblin anatomy and may cause them grievous
            injuries. When the character causes Harm to a goblin, that Harm is AGGRAVATED,
            marked accordingly on the Harm track. Such Harm does not shake down and cannot
            be healed naturally. Additionally, the goblin suffers penalty dice equal to the
            highest aggravated level of Harm to any use of his ADAPTATION (V) Ability until
            healed. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Secret of the Skald
          %dd
            Gorenite music is heavily based on poetry; the instruments and singing tend to
            be simple. A character with this Secret can learn and create LAYS, long poetic
            Effects that can be preserved for later and duplicated by teaching the lay to
            another. A skald performing a lay can either take bonus dice equal to the
            Effect (not expending it), or swap his Ability check result with the Effect
            value, depending on whether he wants to rest on the virtues of the original
            text as he remembers it or strive to impress with his account and improvised
            additions. Cost: 1 INSTINCT to invoke, 1 REASON to swap.
          %dt Key of Divided Kin
          %dd
            The character has moved over the Southern Sea and has to deal with the similar,
            but not quite the same people of the new land. 1xp: Small things are different.
            2xp: Society is different, such as existence of guild-towns, or keeping
            thralls. 5xp: Fight over a religious disagreement. Buyoff: Return home.
          %dt Key of Blood
          %dd
            The character believes in justice for his kin and the old values of fealty and
            honor. 1xp: Defend your kin. 2xp: Fight for your clan. 5xp: Choose to side with
            your clan instead of justice. Buyoff: Work against your clan.
          %dt Key of Thrall
          %dd
            The character has become a thrall to a Gorenite clan. He is obligated to work
            for minimal reward and cannot quit, but he has personal liberty, and his
            children will be free clansmen. 1xp: Serve the clan. 2xp: Get rewarded for your
            work. 5xp: Get abused by your master. Buyoff: Become free.
          %dt Key of Craft
          %dd
            The character is a great craftsman, passionate about his art. 1xp: Work on your
            craft. 3xp: Create something great. Buyoff: Break your tools.
          %dt Key of the Coistrel
          %dd
            Coistrels are professional troll-hunters, often associated with the Sky God
            Religion. 1xp: Goblins come up in the scene. 2xp: Encounter goblins. 5xp: Fight
            with goblins. Buyoff: Befriend a goblin.

      %p
        Goren reflects my personal artistic vision a lot more than most of this book
        does. Specifically, the idea of Abrahamic religion and its relationship to the
        world at large and Nordic society in the specific, in both good and ill – I
        wanted to give it a proper treatment. It was a fortuitous coincidence that
        Josh’s vision of witchcraft fit well into my own plans.
      %p
        I’ve played through many, many sessions of thinly veiled critiques of religion
        in my time, complete with inhuman inquisitors and fanatic mobs; it’s possible
        that you’ll get that sort of thing with this material, too, and it’s not the
        end of the world if you do. The way I’ve come to see it, the attitude Finnish
        roleplaying takes towards religion reflects rather directly on the fact that
        our whole society is working to secularize itself and find some reasonable
        balance in regard to the ideas of Lutheranism. It’s just something we need to
        play through to arrive at something new.
      %p
        My immediate play with the Gorenite material has been more understanding and
        less black and white. The Story Guide is very much responsible for pushing
        against the preconceptions other players bring to the table: if a character
        concept is most comfortable with evil witches and faultless chaplains, play
        against that; if the player presumes that the witch hunts are brutal and
        unnecessary, perhaps there even aren’t any; whatever the characters think of
        the trolls, it just might happen that the specific individuals they encounter
        are completely contrary to those expectations, in good or bad.

        actual people and their lives.
      %p
        Witches of Goren can be wise or wicked, and their faith condones both as long
        as they come in harmonious forms. Witchcraft liberates women, but only by
        forcing them to express themselves through the feminine, not by freeing them as
        people.
      %p
        Urbanization of Goren is ultimately going to be the future. What does this mean

        of two parts from separate lists. They used to carry a meaning and reflect the
        hopes of the parents, and often still do in Jošland. A second name is
        patronymic, although in towns they’ve started to develop into actual surnames.

      After the Shadow, the first generation of Gorenites was tied down in a long
      struggle against trolls to reclaim their homeland. In many ways the clans,
      weakened by the Shadow, failed the people then. Instrumental to victory were
      HIGHLAND SAINTS, warrior monks from the Tiserian monasteries at the Roof of the
      World.
    %p
      Now the Sky God Faith has been embraced by nearly all of Goren. It has brought
      justice to where there used to be none; it has brought a literate culture to a
      land that is quickly settling down; it has brought swords of the coistrels,
      troll-slayers, to make Goren possible again.
    %p
      The Sky God Faith is monotheistic, dogmatic, evangelical faith. It is but two
      generations old, and it is yet to be seen what, if anything, it has to offer to
      Near.

        The Tiserian monasteries are a chain of Spartan stone temples that reach ever
        higher up into the Roof of the World. They are ancient; the people of Near have
        always looked to be closer to the sky, and as far back as the monastic records
        go, people have been traveling here for a sense of holiness. The “highland
        saints”, as they are called, were already famous holy men during the imperial
        times. Their martial power was feared, as it was well known that they fought
        the frost giants of the mountains through the harshest of winters.
      %p
        The highland saints used to be reclusive before the Shadow, but afterwards
        things changed: as Gorenite lands below the mountains disintegrated into chaos
        during the troll age, monastic orders stepped up to support the clans. These
        assaults from the mountains are called CENOBITIC ACTIONS in the monastic
        language, to contrast with eremitic actions sometimes taken by individual
        hermits.
      %p
        The creed that Cenobitic Actions brought down to the lowlands is now called the
        Sky God Faith, a rapidly spreading religious renewal of the tired land.
        Highland saints and preachers are popular among the people because they have
        magic that works against the trolls, and they have justice; the Sky God Faith
        does not distinguish between clansmen and strangers, their laws are the same
        for everybody.  Thus members of Sky God congregations can expect to be treated
        with dignity, just like clansmen.
      %p
        The saints themselves are now tired and their ranks are thin after fighting a
        century to secure the Gorenite highlands from trolls and antagonistic
        witch-women. The reality of bringing wisdom to an ingrate population has been a
        disappointment to many, and they have returned back to their mountain abodes.
        Preachers of the faith step in to pick up the slack and maintain the zeal of
        laymen eager to seek virtue. It is unlikely that another Cenobitic Action will
        be launched anymore.
      %p
        Note the different implications of the Sky God Faith, Sky God Religion and Sky
        God Church. All three terms are used by Gorenites, often revealing different
        degrees of foresight concerning the direction the movement is taking.

      %p
        Ideologically the Sky God Faith is dogmatic and monotheistic: the God is
        invisible and one, living in the Sky. Virtue comes from listening to his word,
        revealed in nature. Vice is associated with lowlands, lavish waste and Trollish
        ways, such as mining. Virtue and Vice are recognized by their consequences, and
        a virtuous man should not be afraid to judge the boundary in between. Magic is
        a force empowered by virtue or vice, and not to be invoked lightly.
      %p
        In practice the highland saints are committed to bringing virtue to the
        Gorenites; they believe that a good life will be rewarded by the community here
        and now, if only the community remains true. The saints have started churches
        in all the largest towns of Goren and sent preachers to teach in the
        countryside, hoping to convince the clansmen of the wisdom of just thought and
        action.
      %p
        Interestingly enough, the Sky God Faith is a book religion: the highland saints
        have brought with them a great number of teaching texts that have been compiled
        with recent histories of the cenobitic actions – the result is called the Book
        of Light, and while its sources range from old imperial philosophy to Oranide
        poetry, it is slowly becoming established as the definition of the Sky God
        Faith. The stories of Lowden Mountain Man, the commander of the second
        cenobitic action, are an inspiration for preachers and laymen alike.

        %a#virtues-of-the-sky-god{:name => "virtues-of-the-sky-god"} Virtues of the Sky God
      %p
        The highland saints practice a virtue ethic that is best expressed in the
        dictum “God helps those who prove worthy of aid”. NATURAL virtues are those
        that come to humans without effort, as long as they are humble. CIVIC virtues
        are things like self-sacrifice and honor, which come with experience with the
        world and society. The saints have a complex philosophical system that charts
        out different virtues and their interrelations from first principles to the
        highest spiritual virtue.
      %p
        Virtues of the highland saints are represented as Abilities in the game. This
        is not because others could not be virtuous in these ways; rather, it is
        because only with Sky God adherents (and others who learn these Abilities) do
        we give the option of testing the character’s virtue directly, as a matter of
        conflict. You might wish to consider such a conflict more of an internal than
        an external matter: the issue is not whether the character can do something,
        but whether he will. The player choice to use one of these Abilities is a sign
        of willingness to leave the character’s intent up to the dice in this matter.
        The whole concept of virtue presumes that people can, to an extent, learn to
        act better by some measure.
      %p
        Virtue Abilities are all considered Passive Abilities when that is useful,
        usable in all the ways the standard Passive Abilities are. I should note that
        the Story Guide’s job regarding virtue Abilities is pretty much to say no to
        the player who’d want to use them to do everything. Rather, presume that a
        virtue can never be used for a non-passive purpose, except in a dramatic
        situation or through a Secret. Characters might get around this with the SECRET
        OF SYNERGY and other means, of course.
      %p
        As practical advice, I suggest taking the virtues as a challenge for gaming
        technique, as that’s sort of why I find them interesting myself. Consider the
        classical RPG PENDRAGON as an established example of what might be done here,
        perhaps, and keep an open mind. I haven’t had trouble applying the virtues
        myself, but I can imagine how they might confuse a player who is not prepared
        for the full implications of turning personality traits into Abilities. The
        Story Guide will do well to remind a player creating his paladin character that
        he will enforce the need for concrete, material Abilities, allowing the virtues
        to be pinged only in the truly dramatic or clearly internal struggles.

        %a#blessings-of-virtue{:name => "blessings-of-virtue"} Blessings of Virtue
      %p
        BLESSINGS are magical Secrets activated by the virtues; the Tiserian cenobites
        know of many miracles based on the holy writings, but individuals are limited
        to blessings they are granted – afterwards the saint who qualified for a
        blessing once may use it freely, nobody can take it away from him unless he
        relinquishes it to another. Blessings are handled like Secrets, except that
        they are only learned through Secrets such as the SECRET OF THE AXIOM, QUEST or
        HAGIOGRAPHY, or perhaps as bequeathal from a saint close to death.
      %p
        Blessings have different strength depending on the virtues they draw upon. This
        is reflected in their mechanical design. The following limitations are what I
        use: a Blessing with only natural virtues may not have a Pool cost above 1. A
        Blessing with a civic virtue may have a Pool cost of at most 2. A Blessing with
        the spiritual virtue would be limited to a Pool cost of 3. Humble Blessings, if
        there are any, would have no Pool costs at all.
      %p
        As always, remember that while we discuss Blessings being “granted by God” and
        such, this is just how the characters themselves perceive the matter. We the
        players know that God does not make judgments in Near – indeed, God has no
        mechanical impact in the game mechanics whatsoever.

            Valor is the natural virtue of daring to stand up for your beliefs. It is
            mostly used to support decisive action, but it may be used directly in simple
            tests of courage as well. VALOR is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Compassion (I)
          %dd
            Compassion is the natural virtue of caring for your fellow man. It is mostly
            useful for supporting empathic action, but direct use might be feasible in
            some social situations. COMPASSION is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Honesty (R)
          %dd
            Honesty is the natural virtue of truthful word and action. It is mostly useful
            in supporting earnest action, but direct use might be possible in certain
            social situations. HONESTY is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Secret of Civic Virtue
          %dd
            The Book of Light calls higher virtues that may only be fulfilled through
            society CIVIC virtues. These are Abilities just like the natural virtues,
            except that they are always associated with two Pools. JUSTICE (I, R), for
            example. With this Secret the character may learn these more complex virtues.
          %dt Justice (I,R)
          %dd
            Justice is the civic virtue of caring for the rights of others. It is mostly
            useful in supporting legal procedures or similar truth-seeking, but direct use
            might be possible when gripped by righteous fury. JUSTICE is a Passive
            Ability.
          %dt Sacrifice (V,I)
          %dd
            Sacrifice is the civic virtue of daring to give for others. It is mostly
            useful in supporting daring actions for good causes, but direct use might
            be possible when faced with certain loss. SACRIFICE is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Secret of Spiritual Virtue
          %dd
            The Book of Light calls the singular highest virtue by the name of SPIRITUAL,
            as it may only be fulfilled in communion with God. The spiritual virtue is an
            Ability just like other virtues, except that it is always associated with
            three Pools. With this Secret the character may learn SPIRITUALITY (V,I,R).

          %dt Spirituality (V,I,R)
          %dd
            Spirituality is the virtue of believing in principle before consequence and
            moral good over material good. I can imagine using it to support other
            Abilities now and then. SPIRITUALITY is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Secret of the Axiom
          %dd
            A character with this Secret may gain Blessings. Either he asks for one with
            PRAY (V), or has an AXIOMATIC REVELATION with an appropriate virtue Ability.
            In the former case the player chooses the Blessing (designing it with the
            Story Guide if necessary), while in the latter the Story Guide chooses a
            Blessing that relies on the virtue in question. Either way, the Blessing
            costs an Advance. Cost: 7 minus the check result in Ability-appropriate Pool
            Requirement: Have no vices.
          %dt Blessing of Light
          %dd
            The character may make himself or a held token shine with unearthly light. Use
            an HONESTY (R) check for a revealing light or a VALOR (V) check for a blinding
            one. The check result may be used as penalty dice against creatures of the
            night. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Healing
          %dd
            The character can heal others of their ills with a preternatural force that
            makes things whole. Use a COMPASSION (I) check for physical injuries and
            HONESTY (R) for others. This may only be done immediately after noticing the
            injury; hesitation closes the window. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the
            Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Spirit Strike
          %dd
            The character can see and strike his opponent’s spirit in combat. This not
            only
            allows fighting with spirits, but also renders conventional armor useless
            against the character; does nothing against spiritless targets, though. Use a
            COMPASSION (I) check against misguided opponents and VALOR (V) against evil;
            the check result difference against the opponent’s RESIST (R) becomes
            persistent bonus dice in conflict against this one opponent. The result can be
            made into an Effect to extend its duration. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the
            Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Lowden the Judge
          %dd
            The character can unearth the truth by divine insight. Use an HONESTY (R)
            check
            when merely penetrating lies or misdirection and a JUSTICE (I,R) check to
            garner information currently unknown to witnesses. The outcome provides the
            character with pertinent facts equal to the check result regarding a moral
            dilemma. Cost: 1 or 2 Pool associated with the Ability, depending on the
            usage.
          %dt Saintly Blessing
          %dd
            The character can distribute his own Secrets (Blessings included) as Blessings
            to others, with the player redesigning them to accord with the theology
            (appropriate use of Virtues, Pool costs, etc.). Any Secret so distributed is
            lost to the character himself, unless the recipient pays an Advance for it. Use
            SACRIFICE (V,I) when touching the recipient and SPIRITUALITY (V,I,R) if doing
            this at the moment of Transcendence. In the latter case the character is
            literally taken to the Sky, and the player may take his time to distribute the
            character’s Blessings as he pleases to anybody in Near. Cost: 2 Pool associated
            with SACRIFICE (V,I) or 3 with SPIRITUALITY (V,I,R).
          %dt Secret of Monastic Life
          %dd
            The character’s Pool spend caps for all of his Virtue Abilities are raised by
            one, akin to the SECRET OF CONDITIONING. This Secret may be picked multiple
            times.
          %dt Key of Courage

            Highland saints teach that without Courage any virtue will fail when it truly
            matters. 1xp: Express a courageous virtue. 2xp: Suffer for virtuous reasons.
            5xp: Lose something for the same. Buyoff: Act in cowardice.
          %dt Key of Love
          %dd
            Love is the direction of virtue for the highland saints, who teach that only
            humans are capable of this transcendent passion. 1xp: Express a loving virtue.
            2xp: Change a life to better it. 5xp: Save another’s life. Buyoff: Act in
            hate. Requirement: Be human.
          %dt Key of Truth
          %dd
            Highland saints consider Truth a basic philosophical principle, without
            which a reasonable world cannot function properly. 1xp: Express a truthful
            virtue. 2xp: Refuse to lie. 5xp: Expose a great lie. Buyoff: Act in untruth.
          %dt Book of Light (R)
          %dd
            The character’s knowledge of the holy texts of the Sky God Faith. This Ability
            is useful for mastering the teachings, comparing editions, distinguishing
            apocryphic content and teaching the book to others. Albeit called a “book”, the
            holy texts are actually still plural and mutating by the moment.
          %dt Secret of Hagiography
          %dd
            The character can learn Blessings from accounts of the BOOK OF LIGHT (R) and
            other holy writings. The Story Guide chooses what is available; the player has
            the right to refuse suggestions equal to the level of success in the Ability
            check. Cost: 1 Reason per activation, cumulative
          %dt Secret of Deaconate
          %dd
            The character is a church official in charge of a parish. He can replace the
            Ability requirements of any Blessing with his knowledge of the BOOK OF LIGHT
            (R) and PRAY (V) when leading the congregation, as assigned by the Story Guide.
            Cost: 1 Pool associated with the original virtue per check, cumulative over the
            scene.
          %dt Key of Hatred
          %dd
            Some Gorenites have taken to justifying their hate with Sky God. They are still
            sincere in their faith, and some are influential deacons. 1xp: Express your
            hate. 2xp: Act on your hate. 5xp: Slay a person you hate. Buyoff: Ask for
            forgiveness.

      Long before the Skyfire, long before the Empire, mankind existed in unspoilt

      revered as the origin and closure of all things. This is the oldest religion.

      %p
        Goren is the Old Country, the nest of witchcraft. In Goren stands WITCHMOUNT
        wherein covens gather in council. However, today the Gorenites have turned from
        their witch women to embrace the new Sky God Faith. It is even said that
        witches have been burned at stake, for the highlands saints consider some
        aspects of the Goddess suspect and all of them false worship.
      %p
        In Jošland, however, witchcraft remains as strong as ever: witch women advice
        and aid the people in their relations with each other and the two worlds.
        Witches live among the people and gather in covens for private worship. The
        bravest still travel to Witchmount like they did before the Year of Shadow;
        others look closer for meetings.
      %p
        Gorenite witchcraft is usually only taught in a concerned manner to
        WITCHBLOODED individuals, which almost always means children of witches.
        Witches can marry, but that often means reducing their commitment to coven
        activities, so many have children out of wedlock. An exception to the avoidance
        of marriage is the practice of TRIUNE MARRIAGE, a custom unique to Goren: clan
        chiefs and other important men of the community may, should they choose to do
        so, seek another wife from among witch women.  This is usually encouraged by
        Gorenite covens, and most witches indeed consider only chieftains worthy enough
        mates for themselves. There also exists a belief in strengthening the blood by
        marriages among the accomplished.
      %p
        Triune married witches do not settle down like normally married women in Goren
        do; they meet their husband as suits both parties, while the secular wife takes
        care of the chief’s household. The witch is expected to advice her husband, but
        any children he begets are her own to do with as she would. The children of the
        witchwife cannot inherit the chief and in theory there should be no animosity
        between the two wives, even while some sagas teach the opposite.
      %p
        Male children of witch women usually go into secular crafts, following their
        fathers; children from triune marriages are often adopted as bastards to the
        chief’s household. WARLOCKS, male witches, are despised, and while the witch
        blood may run true in male children, teaching the art to the boy is never
        encouraged.

          indirectly, without honor?
        %p
          Instead, men of Goren ask the womenfolk for advice in spiritual matters. And
          when they truly fear for themselves in front of the supernatural, they call on

        As all witches know, the Goddess has three aspects: Maiden, Mother and Crone.
        All women embody the Aspects throughout their natural lives, moving through
        them in order.
      %p The first aspect is MAIDEN who is sinless and flawless, unblemished by the touch of morality. She inflames the passions of men – who seek purity – and she keeps the Harmonic Covenant with the natural world. She is rather than does, resists all and bends to none.
      %p
        The second aspect is MOTHER who is weathered and strong, rooted to the real
        world. She rules and makes decisions, runs a household, cooks and cures, crafts
        and raises children to her will. She meets with the other women and finds the
        Covenant of Accord in their midst.
      %p
        The third aspect is CRONE who is tough and wise, knowful of what is. She
        answers questions of things generally forgotten, guides the young and fights
        the fights others see not. She is a solitary figure, mindful of being and
        imposing the Covenant of Seeming upon the traditional beings.
      %p
        The knowledge of the Aspect Abilities is an everyday thing for women, there
        need not be any witchery in being a good daughter, mother or grandmother.
        Neither does a woman need direct life experience to know these Abilities; most
        will have some little understanding of each of them long before (and after) it
        is their time to live in the prescribed role.

        Witchery starts with simple things, wisdom that is only barely magical. We call
        these TRICKS. Each Trick set is a little Secret about how the world is made.
      %p
        As can be seen from the examples, Tricks really manifest as several little
        effects which can reflect different Aspects of the Goddess. These can be
        IMPROVISED: if the character encounters a situation where knowing the tricks to
        breath can be applied, the player can create a new trick for her bag. The
        limitations are really just that the trick has to draw on one of the Aspects
        the character knows, and it can’t be strong and central enough to be considered
        a Secret on its own; tricks are less important and powerful than feasible
        Secrets by definition. (Note that “smaller than Secret” is ultimately
        campaignspecific, just as judging individual Secrets for strength is.)
      %p
        An improvised trick can be written down by the player if he wants, just like
        the example tricks are, but he doesn’t have to. The difference is that if he
        does, the Story Guide has less grounds for complaint next time the same trick
        might be used. This is not to say that tricks are any more immutable than
        anything else in the crunch landscape; tricks can be turned into Arcana
        (explained later) and vice versa as the group’s sensibilities dictate.
      %p
        Everybody can learn the tricks, and it doesn’t take that long to do so. They’re
        not useful without understanding of the Aspects, that’s all.

        %p
          When creating new Tricks for play, choose the theme of the Tricks and pick one
          or two facets it has. There’s little need to try to define more than you
          immediately need.
        %p
          A good idea for “weakening” a Trick in comparison to an equivalent Secret is to
          take into account the necessity of the Ability check, and perhaps give the
          Trick one point more of a Pool cost than you’d give it if it were a separate
          Secret. As a rule of thumb, utilizing a slightly exotic SECRET OF SPECIALTY via
          a trick is quite fine for my game; it’s a borderline-weak Secret for my typical
          crunch landscape anyway, adding an Ability check takes it into trick territory
          for sure.
        %p
          On the other hand, if a player gets a good idea for a Trick application, but
          it’s too powerful, the Story Guide may choose to offer it as an Arcana later
          on, or even on the spot for witchblooded characters.
        %p
          Traditional Gorenite witchcraft draws on anatomical themes for its Tricks, but
          perhaps other ways are possible as well. As Gorenite witches explain it, the
          world is the body of the Goddess, which makes it possible for the witch to
          manipulate like with like, the world with their own body.

        %a#embodying-the-aspects{:name => "embodying-the-aspects"} Embodying the Aspects
      %p
        Women who want to be witches worship the Goddess. They live according to their
        chosen Aspect and gain Her blessings. Sometimes they do this instinctually and
        without knowledge of witchcraft, although this is rare.
      %p
        Usually a witch will only embody one of the Aspects, the one that accords with
        her current role in life. Some witches manage two Aspects simultaneously,
        especially when their lives are in flux. A witch is considered to be embodying
        an Aspect as long as she has the Key of the Aspect in question.
      %p
        A serious witch will sometimes find that she needs to draw on the magic of an
        Aspect she does not embody. An old woman needs the powers of seduction, or a
        young one has to strike down her foes. Such a witch may RAISE THE ASPECT she
        needs by other means; some sample rituals are provided as Secrets.

          %a#arcana{:name => "arcana"} Arcana
        %p
          Actual witchcraft comes in the form of ARCANA, Secrets that the Goddess
          provides to her adherents. Each Arcana comes with a limiting BAN and an
          associated Aspect; the witch can only use the arcane power if she embodies the
          Aspect and upholds the ban, although she can teach the Secret to others
          regardless of either. Arcana looks like this:
        %blockquote
          %dl.docutils
            %dt Arcana of Maiden: Flight
            %dd
              The character can fly freely with the winds, coming down wherever the Goddess
              wills. Alternatively, she can take a token of earth and air with her to control
              the flight and go where she would; the flight lasts until she touches the
              ground. Tying her hair will prevent the witch from flying in this manner until
              the next nightfall; if her hair is cut, it needs to regrow before she can fly
              again. Cost: 2 INSTINCT for flight, 1 more for control. Requirement: Embody
              Maiden.
        %p
          Arcanas might not spell it out, but the corresponding Aspect Ability is used if
          any conflicts arise over the use of the Arcana. Other Abilities may also play a
          role, depending on what the character is doing, exactly.
        %p
          The Ability to develop Arcana via the SECRET OF WITCH BLOOD is considered the
          mark of the true witch in Goren. However, they may also be learned through
          ritual magic (below) or from other witches, usually in coven environment.

            %dt Secret of Raising the Maiden
            %dd
              The character may embody the Goddess Aspect of Maiden temporarily with a
              successful MAIDEN-WAYS (I) check. The result of the check becomes an Effect
              representing the persistence of the Aspect. The witch needs to engage in sexual
              intercourse weekly to retain the Aspect. The Aspect will also dissolve if the
              witch’s desirability is challenged by a RESIST (R) check that overcomes the
              Aspect Effect. Cost: 3 INSTINCT
            %dt Secret of Raising the Mother
            %dd
              The character may embody the Goddess Aspect of Mother temporarily with a
              successful MOTHER-WIT (V) check. The result of the check becomes an Effect
              representing the persistence of the Aspect. The witch needs to craft a doll she
              dotes upon daily to retain the Aspect. The Aspect will also dissolve if the
              witch’s motherhood is challenged by a REACT (R) check that overcomes the Aspect
              Effect. Cost: 3 VIGOR
            %dt Secret of Raising the Crone

              The character may embody the Goddess Aspect of Crone temporarily with a
              successful CRONE-WISE (R) check. The result of the check becomes an Effect
              representing the persistence of the Aspect. The witch needs to perform
              significant blood-letting rites every season to retain the Aspect. The Aspect
              will also dissolve if the witch’s fearsome visage is challenged by an ENDURE
              (V) check that overcomes the Aspect Effect. Cost: 3 REASON
            %dt Secret of Witch Blood
            %dd
              Witch blood runs strong in the veins of the daughters of Goren. Usually only
              witchbloods are initiated into covens. The benefit of the blood is that the
              character can improvise Arcana: whenever the player develops an improvisation
              that is too strong for a Trick, the Story Guide can declare it an Arcana
              instead, and one which the character can immediately learn. Thus the character
              can improvise Arcana.
            %dt Secret of the Warlock
            %dd
              The character can learn Aspect Abilities and initiate into Gorenite witchcraft
              despite being male. Also, the character can use the appropriate Aspect
              Abilities to masquerade as a female well enough to fool other people.
            %dt Herbalism (R)
            %dd
              Gorenite women use many herbs and natural remedies in their everyday life,
              which reflects on their witchcraft as well. The Ability is useful for finding
              and preparing herbal cures, drugs and poisons of various sorts. The Gorenite
              lands are relatively bare, though, so the number of plants is not infinite;
              usually there is just one for each distinct purpose.
            %dt Secret of Potion-making
            %dd
              The character knows how to create POTIONS, Tricks that can be administered to
              others. The appropriate Trick is performed, and the check used to support a
              HERBALISM (R), HOUSEWORK (R) or other appropriate craft check, which then
              becomes an Effect; the Effect can be given to another character or stored for
              later need. Once consumed, the Effect replicates the Trick in question at the
              Effect’s level. Cost: The cost of the Trick and the Effect.
            %dt Tricks of Breath
            %dd
              The character knows how breath, wind and life go together.
              %strong Maiden:
              The
              character’s singing is pleasing to both man and beast, even if clearly not high
              art. Use MAIDEN-WAYS (I) to replace MUSIC (I). Cost: 1 INSTINCT
              %strong Mother:
              A
              successful MOTHER-WIT (V) check allows the character to gain one point of
              REASON or INSTINCT by calming her breath. Suffer a penalty die for each
              cumulative use per day. Cost: 1 VIGOR
              %strong Crone:
              A successful CRONE-WISE (R)
              check allows the character to stop breathing and feign death. Turn the result
              into an Effect to carry it for several scenes. Cost: 1 REASON
            %dt Tricks of Hair
            %dd
              %strong Maiden:
              A successful MAIDEN-WAYS (I) check makes the character’s hair
              change in color and length.
              %strong Crone:
              A successful CRONE-WISE (R) check makes
              treated hair tough like steel wire, and sharp as well if she wants. Cost: 1
              REASON
            %dt Arcana of Maiden: Shapeshift
            %dd
              The character can change her seeming into that of a natural beast. She gains
              the attributes of one, and gets to swap any number of her Abilities and Secrets
              for those appropriate to that kind of animal. The change is permanent until
              dispelled. The character can only change her shape (to either direction) when
              nobody else knows where she is. Cost: 2 INSTINCT for large mammals, 4 for
              others. Requirement: Embody Maiden
            %dt Arcana of Mother: Command
            %dd
              The character can force others to do as she wills by the mere use of her voice.
              However, if the other person is hurt in consequence, her voice loses its power
              for as long as it takes for the injury to heal. Cost: 2 VIGOR per target.
              Requirement: Embody Mother
            %dt Arcana of Mother: Healing
            %dd
              When the character heals Harm with an Ability check, she can spend Vigor to
              raise the effective level of healing on a 1:1 basis. The patient has to stay in
              bed for a day per point spent, however, or the Harm comes back. Cost: 1+ VIGOR
              Requirement: Embody Mother
            %dt Arcana of Crone: Spirit Sight
            %dd
              The character can see invisible and hidden things, including seeing through
              lies. When it comes to conflict over this, she can pay the difference between
              the check results in REASON to tie the opponent and make the result
              inconclusive (effectively meaning that she suspects but does not know). If she
              refuses to know something, however, the sight is lost until the truth is
              revealed to her. Cost: 1+ REASON Requirement: Embody Crone
            %dt Arcana of Crone: Horror
            %dd
              The character can make another feel unreasoning, primal fear by her mere visage
              and voice, intense enough to force the person to escape or even die of fright.
              However, this power is lost if any should laugh at her, only coming back if she
              manages to scare a person again. Cost: 1 REASON for social stakes, 2 for
              escape, 3 for paralysis and eventual death. Requirement: Embody Crone

        %a#goddess-s-high-magic{:name => "goddess-s-high-magic"} Goddess’s High Magic
      %p
        Finally, there is one other facet to witchcraft, RITUAL MAGIC. It is usually
        only practiced by covens due to how exhausting it is, and how useful it is to
        have all Aspects of the Goddess represented in the ritual.
      %p
        The ritual magic practiced by Gorenite witches is called COVENANT RITES due to
        the specific theological leverage the witches employ in contacting and treating
        with the Goddess; other traditions might have other ways to do ritual magic.
        The purpose is in any case singular, to communicate with the Goddess directly
        and consciously.
      %p
        When the Covenant Rites are invoked, the coven can bring to motion several
        magical workings all at one time, unhindered by the limitations of Arcana.
        Witches are not rules-wise limited in advance as to the effects their workings
        may have; instead, they are limited by the following principles:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          The magical working can only affect matters of which the coven has personal
          knowledge among them: people they know, places they’ve seen.
        %li
          The magical working can only act upon the Covenants embodied in the ritual: the
          natural world can only be influenced through the Harmonic Covenant, human
          society through the Covenant of Accord and the inner world through the Covenant
          of Seeming. Should an Aspect of the Goddess not be embodied by a ritual
          participant, the ritual will be completely ineffectual in that sphere.
        %li
          The magical working cannot affect people within the ritual space. Outside
          forces can affect them while they are inside, and they can communicate or leave
          the space, but their magic will not affect anybody within the ritual.
      %p
        Aside from these limitations, there is little the covenant rites cannot
        accomplish, provided the witches are willing to pay the price and try as often
        as it takes to succeed.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#conducting-the-rites{:name => "conducting-the-rites"} Conducting the rites
        %p
          The Covenant Rites are prepared with a successful RITUAL MAGIC (R) check, which
          prepares the ritual ground. This check result may be spent as bonus dice on
          further checks in the ritual. Only witches with the SECRET OF THE COVENANT
          RITES can take active part in the following rites, but others can participate
          by donating support: one Pool point per check may be drawn from a willing
          supporting participant instead of the main ritualists.
        %p
          Preparing the rites can take a day or longer for an unsuitable place, while a
          previously sanctified place can be cleared much quicker. The rites themselves
          can last from an hour to a day or more, depending on the goals of the ritual.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#invoking-the-goddess{:name => "invoking-the-goddess"} Invoking the Goddess
        %p
          The coven chooses which Covenants to call upon when they begin the rite. For
          each invoked Aspect, the embodying witch makes an Aspect Ability check and pays
          7 points minus the check result from the associated Pool. Failed invocations
          may be repeated, but the cost is paid regardless, and failed attempts cause a
          penalty die to retries.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#ritual-activities{:name => "ritual-activities"} Ritual Activities
        %p
          When the invocation has been successful, the witches may begin transforming the
          world. There are two purposes to ritual magic: drawing forth Arcana and
          creating ritual Workings. The witches have to cooperate on either, and can do
          either or both multiple times before closing their ritual down.
        %p
          Nobody can leave the ritual space while the ritual is in progress. Leaving or
          otherwise disturbing the ritual ends any on-going ritual activity without
          effect and sends any finished phases AMISS: the Story Guide decides whether to
          bring the effects of such workings to fruition, when and in what manner.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#workings{:name => "workings"} Workings
        %p
          When the witches want to make something happen in the world, they use WORKINGS.
          Each such working is worded as an Effect and created with one or more Aspect
          checks, depending on the covenants applied in the working.
        %p
          Each individual working is described carefully and visualized by the witches,
          often in many different ways to ensure that the working can find a way to
          actualize in the world. The Pool cost of a ritual working depends on the
          covenant:
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Harmonic Covenant
          %dd
            workings cost INSTINCT points according to the magnitude of the change to the
            natural world: 1 point for a minor change, 10 for a storm of the century, sort
            of like how Three-Corner magic is priced.
          %dt Covenant of Accord
          %dd workings cost one VIGOR point per person directly affected by the magic.
          %dt Covenant of Seeming
          %dd
            workings cost REASON equal to the RESIST (R) check or Effect strength of the
            target, if any. (Among several targets weaker ones support the stronger.)
        %p
          Keeping a working within only one Covenant requires careful visualization of
          the required magic, as the Story Guide takes care of pricing the magic, and he
          relies on his own vision of the working to do so. However, often the cheapest
          way of achieving one’s aims is to traverse through several covenants.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#drawing-forth-arcana{:name => "drawing-forth-arcana"} Drawing Forth Arcana
        %p
          This is much like a ritual working, except that the witches prepare one among
          them to receive a specific Arcana (which somebody needs to design). This is
          done by visualizing the effects of the Arcana, which is again priced by the
          Story Guide according to the Covenant formulas. This does not have to bear
          relation to the costs of using the Arcana in question, only to how the witches
          visualize it.
        %p
          If the drawing forth succeeds, the witch will gain the Arcana when the ritual
          is closed down, and may teach it freely to others as well.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#pool-payments{:name => "pool-payments"} Pool Payments
        %p
          All Pool payments may be shared between witches in any way to which they agree
          during ritual magic. A witch might well find herself out of Pool points midway
          through a ritual regardless. She has two options: sacrifice in compensation, or
          abandon the working.
        %p
          Sacrificing her own blood allows the witch to take on Harm equal in size to the
          amount of Pool she would pay in this way. Sacrificing the blood of others
          allows the witch to drain their Pools (any of them for any of hers) for her
          needs. Animals work as well as people for this purpose. This need not be fatal,
          but the bloodletting is difficult to control.
        %p
          Finally, lay participants in the ritual can offer one appropriate Pool point
          per head into each check made in the ritual. I wouldn’t accept nameless extras
          here (it could become ridiculous), but would rather create a Secret for public
          rituals and their benefits.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#ritual-effects{:name => "ritual-effects"} Ritual Effects
        %p
          Once a ritual Working has been paid for, it becomes an Effect (for no extra
          cost) for one witch who embodies the primary Aspect of the Working. These
          Effects persist after the ritual is finished, and bring about the magic the
          coven visualized.
        %p
          The effect might be immediate, but it might also take a day or two to come
          about, depending on what the witches wanted: an animal attack against a hostile
          chief might happen the very next night, while the estrangement between two
          people could happen over a season, for example. The Story Guide has control
          over the pacing of the ritual magic, except for one thing: the next time the
          witch learns of the target of her magic, the magic has either succeeded or
          failed. A witch should thus not be too hasty in finding out whether her magic
          worked, so as to not force it to effect at an inopportune moment.
        %p
          If the working targets a person directly or indirectly, the target can defeat
          the magic in ways that depend on the nature of the attack: a hostile animal
          attack could be beaten off by force of arms, for example. Conflicts against the
          magic are against the ritual Effect created by the witch. In whatever way the
          magic comes, the Effect value is what the victim has to match. Workings that
          nobody resists come about without fail, of course. Also, if the Working is
          forced to act in an awkward manner due to haste or foreknowledge by the target,
          the Story Guide may assign circumstance penalties to the Working: these are
          deducted directly from its value.
        %p
          A powerful working with drastic consequences will probably be taken to an
          extended conflict by a player character victim. This works the way extended
          conflicts with Effects usually do, as far as the mechanics are concerned; the
          wise witch might send several Effects against powerful opponents to compensate
          for their frailty, or she might use the SECRET OF THE WARRIOR RITE to tie her
          own well-being into the working.

              Gorenite witchcraft does not involve rituals in its everyday application, but
              they take precedence at covens and actual worship. This Ability can be used to
              support other magical Abilities when they’re applied in a ritual context:
              deliberate tools, environment and action help to focus the magic. The Ability
              is also useful in interpreting strange rituals, developing new ones and might
              support PRAY (V) in some situations as well.

            %dd
              The character has the basic knowledge required for participating in Gorenite

              working.
            %dt Secret of Blood-letting
            %dd
              The character is skilled in blood rituals, and can make a RITUAL MAGIC (R)
              check to cause Harm to a ritual sacrifice and draw an equal number of Pool
              points from it, just like if she were shedding her own blood. The target has to
              beat the level of Harm with ENDURE (R) to stay conscious; if repeated to an
              unconscious victim, this is fatal, as is going over MORTAL (6) Harm.
            %dt Secret of the Warrior Rite
            %dd
              When the character creates a ritual Working in the Covenant Rites, she may
              connect herself to the Working, making checks and taking Harm through it, just
              like it was herself who took the form of the magic. A Working like this is
              controlled by the player in how and when it comes about; however, it may
              manifest in at most as many scenes as its Effect value indicates before
              dissipating. The character herself is only vaguely aware of what the Working is
              doing on her behalf; Harm manifests as dizziness and illness that drains her of
              life. Requirement: SECRET OF THE COVENANT RITES

              Working that is visualized to accord with a magic in her Arcana is not
              considered for the cost of the working. In this use her Arcana may target
              others than herself as well. Requirement: SECRET OF THE COVENANT RITES

    %p
      The Vulfen are an inhuman race of lupine beastfolk. They mainly live in the
      eponymous southern wastes of Vulfland. Vulfen are heavy-built creatures that
      most closely resemble dire wolves the size of man, with long snouts and
      powerful hind legs. Their armlegs are more adapted to a running gait than
      manipulating things; the favored locomotion of the creature is a slow bound on
      four legs, capable of traversing long distances.
    %p
      Vulfen are intelligent yet savage, with an inborn inclination towards
      directness and predatory violence. They are also loyal and honorable, however,
      as well as sociable, just like the wolves they resemble.
    %p
      As the Shadow Night recedes, so does the place Vulfen have in Near. They are
      not likely neighbors to humans, but would rather be rulers or slaves.

        Vulfen are not known in Maldorian records from before the Year of Shadow, but
        according to their own legends, they’ve always been in the world, confined to
        the most distant south. When the Shadow Night rose and temperatures fell all
        over Near, Vulfen prospered in the lands suddenly inhospitable to humans. As
        the Southern Sea froze over, some even crossed over and staked territory in
        Near.
      %p
        As the Shadow Night has receded, most Vulfen remain in Vulfland, the extensive
        swath of tundra and borderline glacier in the interior of the southern
        continent. They do prosper in the maritime taiga as well, but the Jošland
        Gorenites have largely driven them inland over the last generation.  This does
        little to reduce their numbers: Vulfland is an enormous area, almost as large
        as Near itself, with plenty of room for the current Vulfen population.
      %p
        Vulfen packs subsist on a diet of hunted deer and smaller animals, as well as
        megafauna of the far interior. Nothing threatens them in their habitat, their
        ferocity and intelligence makes them the match of the largest mammoth.
      %p
        Despite their natural superiority, prosperity does not come easy to Vulfen
        packs: winters in Vulfland are harsh even with thick natural pelts, and bad
        hunting can lead to outright starvation. Vulfen are not accustomed to mercy in
        their cruel land.

        %a#pack-society-politics{:name => "pack-society-politics"} Pack Society Politics
      %p
        Vulfen are competitively social: they put great stock to honor and face among
        the pack, to such a degree that they can’t quite enjoy life in isolation from a
        pack of worthy peers. Respect and expecting respect comes naturally to the
        Vulfen.
      %p
        The pack itself is organized akin to a wolf pack: there is an alpha Vulfen
        called VALRU and perhaps some beta VAL. A particularly powerful valru is termed
        a RUVALRU, the master of many packs. Originally all these terms refer to
        kinship: “valru” is a parent, “ruvalru” a grandparent and so on.
      %p
        A Vulfen will be uncertain without a clear hierarchy and will often challenge
        others for dominance simply to find out where he belongs. Even the
        scapegoat-like HAR on the lowest rung of the pack politic are happier when they
        know their position unequivocally.
      %p
        Vulfen have become socialized to humans in different ways: most Vulfland Vulfen
        make use of human dexterity when it serves their needs, going so far as to
        capture humans into servitude as FETCHES, hand-servants. Some rogue Vulfen may
        adopt a human tribe in lieu of their pack, often becoming kings or even gods to
        the human community, depending on their reaction to the lupine. Vulfen do not
        need human amenities, but they easily come to enjoy cooked food, shelter and
        other perks of civilization.
      %p
        Outside the cold and sparse Vulfland the balance between humans and the
        occasional Vulfen shift: a lone Vulfen finding himself deep within civilized
        territory often ends up hunted as a “werewolf” or captured. Such a Vulfen may
        be tamed and become civilized after a fashion, coming to appreciate the
        creature comforts that humans can offer. Being tamed is shameful for the
        Vulflanders, who might slay a weakling or pup unable to cope with the harsh
        life of Vulfland.
      %p
        The lure of civilization in its different forms is a perennial source of
        internal conflict among Vulfen: many Vulfland valru consider it an identity
        issue that Vulfen are akin to the wolf and despise any sign of civilization as
        weakness. Others disagree, preferring to interact with humans in different
        ways.
      %p
        A similar divided curiosity governs the way Vulfen relate to wolves, which are
        rare in Vulfland, outhunted by Vulfen themselves. Vulfen who would respect
        their primordial way of life often look up to true wolves, gladly adopting them
        into the pack; after all, the wolf is not conflicted by human concerns of
        morality. Others are shamed or angered by wolves, which to them seem like
        stunted, incomplete Vulfen.

      %h3
        %a#dreams-of-agarim{:name => "dreams-of-agarim"} Dreams of Agarim
      %p
        Vulfen tend to scoff at religious notions – not because they do not believe in
        unseen forces (they have good noses, after all) or because they do not believe
        in spirits; it’s just that they consider themselves wolf spirits and heirs of
        Agarim the Father Wolf already, so they should have little to prove and less to
        ask from other spiritual forces. Again, some Vulfen disagree, especially when
        they’re forced to leave their comfortable pack life on the tundra; while a
        Vulfen would not be likely to stoop to worshipping other spirits, he might
        cooperate with them when their interests coincide.
      %p
        Lacking a religious mind-set does not mean that Vulfen are entirely without
        spiritual experiences. They take dreams very seriously, and hold certain
        respect for powerful dream shamans. While they do not practice dream shamanism
        themselves, Vulfen dreams are important due to their relationship with the
        common ancestor Ru-Agarim, Father Wolf. Most Vulfen believe that their dreams
        are visitations to another world, one in which Agarim reminds them of his way.
      %p
        Of particular import are PROPHETIC dreams, recognized as such when the same
        dream is shared by many Vulfen. Usually prophecies concern only one pack, but
        some of the most important, dealing with Agarim, are known to all packs in
        Vulfland.

            Vulfen are not usually dream-shamans, as the animal totems do not speak to
            them. However, a Vulfen with this Ability is more tuned to Agarim’s dream than
            the rest: the player can invoke a prophetic dream with a successful BESTIALITY
            (V) check; the player gets to choose the topic of the dream, while the Story
            Guide chooses the rest of the dream. If the check is made into an Effect, other
            Vulfen reminded of it have to make a successful RESIST (R) check to not

            penalties for using his hands. The fetch can also act at some distance from the
            Vulfen, though the players should keep in mind how difficult a lone human might

            Additionally, the opponent has to make an immediate ENDURE (V) check after the
            battle against the highest level of aggravated Harm to avoid paying for and
            gaining the KEY OF CRIPPLE, unless he already has it. The player of the victim

      %p
        The Vulfen vision can be savage. I’ve wrestled hard with the issue of whether
        Vulfen are even playable: they are like furry Nazis in so many ways that one
        might assume that they’d only attract players who want to play a monster.
      %p
        As it happens, though, there is a trick to making this work: the Story Guide
        must not downplay the Vulfland environment. The harsh creatures and their
        unforgiving culture start to make sense when they are contrasted with the stark
        reality of the wastes. My impression was completely overturned when we found
        out in play that the Vulfen relationship to their fetches is not necessarily
        one of slavery – it could not be, when the land is so hostile that the Vulfen
        needs to support his fetch just to allow him to survive. What seems like
        exploitation may be cooperation necessitated by survival.
      %p
        This works the other way around, too: when the Vulfen go north, they certainly
        start looking unnecessarily savage if they insist on the values developed on
        the wastes. In my mind the grand narrative here concerns the grandiose Vulfen
        eschatology: how does the proud creature react to realizing that the world is
        much larger and much more complex than he ever realized? What happens when the
        other people in the story find out that ultimately, only those basic Vulfen
        values matter?

          As the name signifies, Vulfen are most common in and around Vulfland. It is

          Some Vulfen packs attack into Jošland during winter, stealing animals and
          causing trouble. This can happen all the way to the coasts, making the people

      Far south of Near, beyond the Southern Sea, beyond the fjords of Jošland, lie
      the continental steppes of the southern continent. The maritime climate gives
      way to dry steppe that remains frozen three fourths of the year, and to
      southern tundra that thaws not at all. Finally, to the extreme south, there
      come the glaciers that grow and splinter in turn as the weather patterns slowly
      seek a new equilibrium.
    %p
      To the Jošlanders this whole frigid desert is known as Vulfland, the land of
      the Vulfen. The predatory beastkin rule a land unsuited to humanity: even in
      summer it’s too cold for a man unclothed, and there is little in the way of
      wood or stone to build from. The Vulfen do not mind, and they make sure that
      civilization does not creep any farther than it may.
    %p
      Still, Vulfland does harbor humans: caribou herders and fishers, and pickers of
      moss and berries that grow up through summer. The Vulfen consider hunting big
      game their own prerogative, and enforce this law harshly, but they do not care
      for the bounty of the sea that remains outside their reach.

      %p
        The southern continent is an extensive landmass that has always been
        inhospitable to habitation according to Maldorian records. The polar shift
        during the Year of Shadow did little to change this; the continent has moved
        farther north alongside the rest of Near, but the weakening of the sun has only
        extended the tundra to areas where once dense boreal forests held sway.
        Rainfall has increased considerably, however, and now great rivers flow south
        towards the great depression of the renewed southern glacier, slowly building
        up into a reservoir that will become a great arctic sea in time.
      %p
        Human people of Vulfland were there before the Vulfen came, or so they say;
        they call themselves the people, “Inuk”, despite what others say of them.
        Outsiders often ignore these natives in favor of the Vulfen packs in their
        tales, even while they trade with the humans for beautiful bone and thick furs
        of arctic beasts.
      %p
        Most of the Inuk live either in small lakeside fishing villages or stay on the
        move, following the half-wild caribou herds as they track the sun north and
        south over the year. Some few are hunters and fishers far in the glacier, out
        of the reach of Vulfen. There is ample trade between these population groups:
        the herders carry surplus production from village to village on their travels,
        while exchanging their bounty of bone and skins for pottery, fish, oils and
        other products of the sedentary villagers. Glacier-walkers trade with yeti and
        come annually or biannually to villages to gain the few supplies they can’t
        make on their own. Marriage customs reflect this interdependence: Vulflanders
        consider a marriage from a village into a herding family or vice versa a
        particularly conspicuous one, as the new family members make for trustworthy
        partners in barter.
      %p
        The humans of Vulfland are submissive towards the Vulfen packs that roam the
        wastes, moving over considerable distances in search of prey. Most packs
        disdain the weak humans, perceived as such because of their dependence on a
        multitude of tools, clothing and foodstuffs scraped from the ground. Through
        the Shadow Night the numbers of humans plummeted and Vulfen even ate human
        flesh, but since then the power relationship has been turning around.

          Characters coming to the tundra for the first time will probably suffer severe
          circumstance penalties if they try to survive on the sparse natural plant life
          and travel long distances. The glacier is even worse: WOODCRAFT (R) does not
          help out there at all, survival basically depends on expert LOCAL (R) knowledge
          and careful preparations made in advance.

        Vulfen are irreligious, but the Vulfland humans have an intense spiritual
        relationship with TOTEM animals, powerful dream spirits that watch over the
        people and regulate their relationship with the natural world; as one story has
        it, the Vulfen themselves are children of the Wolf totem, sent to punish people
        for over-exploitation of their environment.
      %p
        Totems are usually community-specific: herders bring their totem with them as
        they travel, while villages abandon theirs if they are forced to move to a new
        place. Sometimes different genders or occupational groups within the same
        settlement have separate totems. A mystically potent family or even a person
        might also have a totem of their own: in these cases people usually consider
        the person to have some blood of the totem animal in them, explaining the close
        relationship.
      %p
        Some people, called SHAMANS, specialize in communing with the totems and
        recognizing their signs. Most shamans are also expert dreamers; the next
        chapter discusses this facet of their power. The most important duty of a
        shaman in inuk society concerns negotiating with spirits that visit the
        community by possessing its members; some spirits have important tasks they
        need help with, while others just want to have fun and feel the experiences the
        body has to offer. The shaman sorts these out and makes sure the spirit gets
        what it wants, and blesses the community in return.
      %p
        Typical totems include bear, reindeer, seal, walrus, whale, various fish,
        arctic birds, fox, squirrel, wolverine and other common Vulfland animals. Wolf
        totems are not unheard of, but they usually denote a settlement under Vulfen
        control and are not actually active spirits. Communities honor their animal
        totems through special feasts, dances and ceremonies, vision quests, carved
        jewelry, fetishes, and totem-poles.

        %p
          Not all spirits are totemic; some are malicious and not of animal origin, with
          unnatural desires ravaging them at unexpected moments. Some are animal spirits
          driven insane by pain and grief. The general name for these malicious spirits
          is WENDIGO.
        %p
          The wendigo can possess a person in his sleep, but the more common cause for
          spirit possession is the breaking of a spirit taboo, the most prominent of
          which is cannibalism: eating human flesh is cause for spirit possession because
          the flesh entering the body also possesses part of the spirit, which is then
          allowed to enter as well. Animal flesh is safe due to totemic pacts made by the
          ancestors, allowing the animal to give its body willingly while the spirit
          escapes. Humans do not have a totem, and thus their flesh is poisonous with
          spirit.
        %p
          (In case it matters: Vulfen technically do have a totem spirit in Agarim the
          Wolf Father, but as Agarim does not negotiate with people, there is no pact;
          thus Vulfen is also a bad meat.)
        %p
          A being who succumbs to a wendigo finds that he cannot help but think of other
          beings close to him as his prey. They find themselves become withdrawn,
          solitary, but also desperate for the taste of the flesh of other sentient
          creatures. In most cases, an act which was taken for survival's sake becomes an
          allconsuming desire; some wendigo survive for a time by gorging themselves on
          animal prey, but sooner or later, out of desperation or compulsion, they turn
          to others of their own kind. This delights the evil dream which inhabits its
          victim, allowing it to interact with the physical world in the most gruesome of
          ways, savoring the taste of flesh and blood. Some mortals go mad from this
          possession, and take their own lives rather than face their twisted desires.
        %p
          Shamans are trained to battle these evil spirits, and can sometimes drive them
          away from a body. However, a once-wendigo has to be watched closely for the
          rest of his life, as he is now easy prey to evil spirits, without the normal
          protections that totemic pacts afford to the inuk.

              Hospitality is a necessary skill for people who have to be able to band
              together regardless of familiarity. The Ability is used to encounter strangers,
              explain your customs and expectations to them and make sure you both feel
              richer by the interaction. It is also useful in support of other social
              abilities.
            %dt Harpoon (V)
            %dd
              Inuk are not allowed to hunt by the Vulfen, but they’re not prevented from
              doing it on the glacier and in the water. Use this Ability to fell prey with
              the Inuk weapons.
            %dt Local (Glacier) (R)
            %dd
              Some Vulflanders outright live in the glaciers, hunting and fishing and setting
              up temporary camps on the coastlines. This Ability reflects their unique
              survival skills: building structures out of snow and ice, protecting their eyes
              from the glare of the sun, finding their prey through the long dark winter,
              avoiding crevasses and so on.
            %dt Secret of Many Snows
            %dd
              The character is adept at recognizing and dealing with the dangers of the snow
              and ice, such as crevasses, avalanches and breaking ice. When he traps another
              with a LOCAL (GLACIER) (R) check, the target takes an additional Harm equal to
              the number of ‘ ‘ overflow dice in the check. When trying to avoid these
              dangers himself, the character gains a bonus die for each such overflow die.
            %dt Carving (I)
            %dd
              Inuk have little in the way of material possessions, so practically everything
              they own is beautifully carved and decorated, from tent poles to shovels. Wood,
              bone, stone and even ice are used. This Ability is useful in making tools both
              beautiful and usable.
            %dt Secret of Scarification
            %dd
              Vulflanders do not write, but their scarmarks are very intricate and may be
              deciphered with CARVING (I) checks. A character with this Secret can transmit
              specific messages carved to materials, even flesh. Unlike writing, scar-marks
              are context-dependent, and the carver can decide who is supposed to be able to
              interpret the message. The carving check itself can be used as either bonus or
              penalty dice for anybody trying to decipher the message.
            %dt Secret of the Swear
            %dd
              The character can use social Abilities to cause penalty dice to his enemies
              with his terrible language, provided they understand him. However, most other
              languages are not as facile in cursing as Vulfen, so circumstance penalties are
              suffered. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
            %dt Secret of Scar-Rune
            %dd
              A powerful scar-mark created by the master carver can affect the recipient in a
              drastic manner. The rune is an Effect created with CARVING (I); the carver
              determines the message and who is supposed to be able to read it. Whenever it
              is deciphered, the rune causes a dice pool equal to its value, used by the
              player of the carver to help or hinder the task the rune encourages or warns
              against. Cost: 1 REASON to create the Effect. Requirements: SECRETS OF
              SCARIFICATION and SWEAR.
            %dt Secret of the Scentless
            %dd
              Some Inuk are born without a natural scent; it is said that this is the fate of
              those given birth on the glacier under the aurora. Vulfen will usually try to
              slay such humans, but they (and other scent-dependent creatures) suffer a
              penalty die for each ‘-’ overflow die in their own check when interacting with
              the scentless. The scentless in turn suffers an additional penalty die to his
              ANIMAL KEN (I) due to this weird. Requirements: be human, be born with it.
            %dt Secret of the Possessor
            %dd
              The character is possessed by a spirit with personality, name, specific
              motivations and powers. The Story Guide creates the possessor as a dream
              spirit, like the character was its SIDEKICK, except the spirit may choose which
              of the character’s Keys is left active, and the character can’t leave. When the
              possessor wants something, the character has to succeed in a Resist (R) check
              to not obey.
            %dt Secret of Dream Exorcism
            %dd
              The character is experienced in dealing with hostile dream spirits, and can use
              PRAY (V) freely to support his dealings with them, and to exorcise their
              possession if need be. The target of possession regains any Advances they’ve
              been forced to spend on spiritual Secrets when the shaman frees him.
            %dt Secret of Spirit Boon (specify)
            %dd
              Spirit boons are blessings gained by pleasing spirits or mighty totems. They
              are exactly like witchcraft ARCANA, except they employ cultural Abilities and
              require the character to embody the totemic Aspect of the spirit animal the
              blessing comes from. Requirement: a specific KEY OF THE TOTEM
            %dt Key of the Cannibal Urge
            %dd
              The character has eaten of the flesh of a person and thus opened himself to the
              wendigo. 1xp: Eat meat. 2xp: Treat others like food. 5xp: You are suspected or
              accused of being wendigo. Buyoff: Confess and get purified.
            %dt Secret of the Wendigo
            %dd
              Characters with the KEY OF THE CANNIBAL URGE or who have otherwise broken a
              spirit taboo do not pay an Advance for this Secret. The wendigo gains the
              SECRET OF ADDICTION (HUMAN FLESH, VIGOR) for free. Furthermore, this Secret
              does not disappear if the character is exorcised; it causes him to suffer
              penalty dice equal to his currently expended VIGOR to any attempts to resist
              spirit possession when he is currently not being possessed.
            %dt Secret of Waste-Walker
            %dd
              The character is immune to cold and can see heat signatures in total darkness.

              wasted. Requirement: SECRET OF THE WENDIGO
            %dt Secret of Predator
            %dd
              The character gains natural weapons akin to the SECRET OF VULFEN, except the
              player gets to pick the ratings freely. The character can also learn SCENT (I)
              and BESTIALITY (V). Requirement: SECRET OF THE WENDIGO
            %dt Key of the Totem (animal)
            %dd
              The character follows and emulates a totem, either because his community does
              or because the spirit chose him specifically. 1xp: Emulate the totem animal.
              3xp: Serve the totem’s goals, general or specific. Buyoff: Desecrate your
              totem’s fetish.
            %dt Key of the Shaman
            %dd
              The character is considered wise and able to protect the community from the
              supernatural. 1xp: Carve runes or fetishes. 2xp: Advice another. 5xp: Defeat or
              befriend a spirit threatening the community. Buyoff: Abandon the community.
            %dt Key of Marriage
            %dd
              The character would like to get married, which can be far from easy in
              Vulfland. 1xp: Interact with suitable candidates. 2xp: Prepare marriage gifts.
              5xp: Gain the agreement of a person involved, such as everybody’s parents,
              village elders and shamans, and possibly others. Buyoff: Succeed, or leave
              Vulfland.

      %p
        In my playtesting the Inuk have been a remarkably passive subject people to
        which things are done and who do nothing in turn. I wonder what’s up with that?
        Hopefully others will play stories that center on these people who live on the
        border of the universe.
      %p
        Specifically, consider the heroic potential of PERSONAL STORIES. I imagine that
        the Inuk heroes do crazy things for small reasons, like visiting other planets
        to get some wedding gifts for their sweetheart. They also do small things for
        small reasons, like stabbing each other to death for promiscuity. This zooming
        in to small things happens to outsiders as well: life in Vulfland is harsh, and
        sometimes just fighting for your own happiness is more than enough work.

        The wendigo might or might not come with a personalized spirit. If the spirit
        is not personal, then it’s up to the player to play the subliminal urges and
        monstrosity of the character as he wishes.
      %p
        The wendigo is powerful. If it could be controlled and corralled, perhaps it
        could even be a match for a pack of Vulfen: a weapon born of desperation.
      %p
        Meetings between communities are a low-key event for heroic drama, but
        important for the Inuk, for whom new faces mean new marriage and trade
        opportunities. Consider enjoying this material at the pace it sets.
      %p
        Spirit interactions can be interesting, as the smart community goes a long way
        in satisfying the spirit, whatever it wants. But there is a line at which the
        spirit becomes a liability; the good shaman knows where it lies.

      In the deep south the world is less real than up north. Dream and reality mix
      up and entangle so that sometimes you don’t know whether you’re dreaming or
      awake. The Vulflanders have shamans who can walk through the dream and
      distinguish what is not real.
    %p
      Vulfen do not have shamans, but they do respect the power of dreams. Insofar as
      they have religion, it is based on the prophetic dream: when all the Vulfen
      dream together and in one dream, that dream is then known to be true for them

        Reality on the southern glaciers is sometimes mutable, strange sights are seen.
        Green forests and weird beasts may be encountered, things of other words. This
        is because of the SOFT PLACES, areas that have yet not been perceived enough to
        separate the real from the imaginary. Dream shamans sometimes seek these soft
        places because of the power it gives to their dreaming; others dread them for
        the illusionary dangers they may contain.

        The southern aurora is connected to the power of dreams: it is said that dreams
        seen under the twisting polar lights contain great truths about the future.
        Such dreams, when they happen, are thought powerful divination that may come to
        anybody. Seeking the services of a dream shaman is considered most prudent in
        these cases so as to find out what the dream signifies.
      %p
        Aside from dreams of divination, there are dream visitations from totemic
        animals and other dream spirits. Vulfen do not have these dreams, as they do
        not have totemic animals. Humans take these dreams most seriously, however.
      %p
        The last type of powerful dream is the LUCID dream. These are especially
        important for dream shamans, as they can only make purposeful choices in these
        kinds of dreams. A dreamer will not normally realize that he is dreaming, but
        in a lucid dream he does. The dream shaman has usually trained to enter a lucid
        state during his dream; a layman will only enter a lucid dream accidentally or
        when provoked by a dream shaman.

        Other dreams are like recorded plays and can’t be influenced while they are
        running, but lucid dreams are different: they happen in an interactive
        environment, the dreaming of the individual dreamer. Because the lucid dreamer
        is aware and in control of himself, normal scenes may be framed within the
        dream.
      %p
        A character enters a lucid dream by making a DREAM-TELLING (R) Ability check
        while asleep. The check result gives the maximum number of scenes that the
        dream lasts before the character wakes up. A dream may also become lucid when a
        lucid dreamwalker first enters it or interacts directly with the dreamer; in
        this case a REACT (I) check may be used instead.
      %p
        A dreamwalker is a character that can move from his own dream to another’s
        using the SECRET OF DREAMWALKING. A lucid dreamwalker may interact with a
        non-lucid dreamer in the dreamer’s dream; however, non-lucid dreamers may only
        make Passive Ability checks, and they can’t realize that the things and events
        in the dream are not real.
      %p
        Once a lucid dreamer is present, he may opt to shape a dream freely, or act
        within the dream, possibly making Ability checks. A DREAM-TELLING (R) check may
        be required to make complex changes or make emotionally powerful changes
        without waking the dreamer up. Social interaction is possible in a dream almost
        normally, but any action that would cause Harm, refresh Pools or otherwise
        affect the dreamer mechanically will wake the dreamer instead. Secrets can and
        will change this; Vulflanders fear nothing as much as a dream shaman turned
        into an enemy, as a non-lucid layman is all but helpless against a phantasmal
        killer within his own dream; horrible nightmares are the least danger, many
        enemies of dream shamans are found under their own furs in the morning, frozen
        to death as if they’d spent the night naked on the glacier.
      %p
        A lucid dreamer may awake accidentally just like a non-lucid dreamer would, but
        only within his own dream. Within another’s dream he will only wake with a
        DREAM-TELLING (R) check, when his dreamtime runs out or when the other dreamer
        wakes, which wakes up everybody visiting that dream.
      %p
        Aside from the above, dream scenes may be played the same as any scene.
        However, circumstantial penalty dice work differently within a dream: the Story
        Guide may assign up to five penalty or bonus dice to individual checks; he is
        encouraged to make these decisions according to seemingly arbitrary criteria
        that hide a poetic logic. Different things are feasible in a dream than would
        be in reality.

            dreams of the target and making an Effect out of the Ability check; if the
            target later encounters the situation described in the Effect, he has to
            immediately win the Effect with a RESIST (R) check to avoid acting according to

            any Abilities needed within a dream with artistic Abilities, such as STORY-TELL

        The Pool costs of the various dream shaman Secrets are given in generic Pool
        points, but the actual Pool used is not arbitrary: the current MODE of the
        dream determines which Pool the shaman needs to use to activate his magic.
      %p
        Each dream scene always starts with a mode that accords with the largest
        current Pool of the dreaming character. A dreamer may switch the mode by making
        an Ability check: the mode always accords with the last Ability checked in the
        dream scene, but only if it is stronger than the last mode-change.
        DREAM-TELLING (R) does not count; in fact, the associated Pool of the
        DREAM-TELLING Ability itself switches with the mode when the character is
        dreaming.
      %p
        Non-dreaming Secrets, when used within dream, are affected by the mode as well:
        when a character pays points from any Pool, all but one of those points come
        out of the current mode Pool instead. A payment of three VIGOR during a REASON
        mode would turn into 2 REASON and 1 VIGOR, for example.

        Spirits are powerful dreams that do not dissolve when the morning comes.
        Instead, they escape to the soft places to wait out the day. Some, such as
        totem spirits, are ancient, powerful and wise, rarely coming out of the soft
        places. Others are fearsome and hungry, such as the wendigo.
      %p
        Spirits are just like lucid dreamers (in fact, lucid dreamers are like spirits,
        except that they have a body to return to) when it comes to moving through
        dreams, interacting with dreamers and so on and so forth. It is far from
        unknown for a dream shaman to forge relationships with spirits.
      %p
        A dream spirit newly summoned has Advances equal to triple the success level of
        the Ability check used to summon it, distributed in half by the player of the
        dream shaman and half by the Story Guide. Dream spirits may be very imaginative
        in their composition, built out of dream logic. Free spirits of course may have
        whatever statistics the Story Guide finds best. Dream spirits encountered in
        the real world have their strength reduced: halve their Pools and reduce
        Ability levels by one. Dream spirits encountered during the day are also
        fragile: anybody who has a reason to suspect may make a REACT (I) check to
        recognize the creature for a dream and dissolve it. For this reason dream
        spirits almost never make an appearance outside the soft places and dreams.
        Dream items brought out into the world follow similar rules: their quality
        drops by one, and a successful disbelief causes the item to disappear. For this
        reason a dream shaman might make his dream equipment seem mundane, so as to
        avoid disbelief.

      %p
        Soft places are powerful because they are half-dream themselves. Entering a
        soft place is like entering a true dream space from the SECRET OF TRUE DREAM:
        the place has a mode, DREAM-TELLING (R) and dream shamanism Secrets work
        normally and so on. However, a person entering a soft place in waking life is
        really there: anything that happens to him is real.
      %p
        Pure soft places have a direct connection to dreaming: there is nothing
        preventing a real being from moving into the dream or a dream spirit or item
        from becoming real in a soft place, provided they know how to dreamwalk and
        know of the soft place. A person going bodily into the dream cannot awaken
        accidentally or by force; they are like a dream spirit. A person who comes out
        of a soft place into the world during a dream endangers his original body most
        gravely; he also loses one level from all of his Abilities and half of his
        Pools until he returns to the dreaming and/or his own body.
      %p
        Most soft places are actually in the process of hardening, so they are not so
        pure anymore: in these places circumstance penalties may be suffered,
        manifesting spirits may be even weaker, going into the dream bodily may not
        work at all and the power of dream is otherwise limited. Dream shamans both
        fear and covet pure dreaming places for their great power.

        person himself. However, this is nothing compared to the differences between

          beastkin most reflecting their inner spirit (SG choice); this may be an

      Vulfen do not know religion. The closest they come is a belief in prophetic
      dreams, which is hardly baseless on the boreal plains. However, Vulfen do have
      an eschatology, a racial destiny if you will. All packs tell this story, and
      they often dream of it as well. The humans of Vulfland tell the story, too;
      indeed, theirs is often the more evocative and detailed telling.
    %p
      Father Wolf Agarim was the first being who killed and ate of his kill. This
      happened when the world was new, cold and dark. Agarim then was just an animal,
      content to merely exist in all the ways that wolves do.
    %p
      Things from the deep waters attacked and forced animals to leave Agarim’s
      territory. They were large and of many forms. Agarim fought back and hunted his
      rivals to the soft places of the world.
    %p
      Later Agarim beget all beasts, which started the first Wolf Age. All other
      animals multiplied greatly and became food to the carnivores.
    %p
      The first Wolf Age was timeless, and therefore had to end. This was signified
      when the sun rose, bringing with it warmth and people. Where the sun reached,
      it brought people with their houses and tame animals. Wolves retreated to
      places that people did not want.
    %p
      When animals came to contact with people, their ways changed and they came to
      depend on the humans for succor. Men sent heroes into the soft places to tame
      them; their presence caused the soft places to fold up and give way.
    %p
      When the great empire rose in Near, natural ways were cast aside. Even many men
      knew then that the natural order had been shaken; they looked for refuge on the
      southern continent, far from the grasp of the emperor.
    %p
      Everything comes to an end, but for few things it comes in as spectacular
      manner as it did for the Empire of Maldor. Agarim, who had slept through the
      Sun Age, opened his Eye: it was like a burning disk in the sky, slowly opening
      into something greater than the Sun itself.
    %p
      Agarim swallowed the Sun and cast the world back into the darkness, intent on a
      new Wolf Age ruled by his children. This act was significant, for it revealed a
      change in Agarim as well: like the other animals, he was also changed by men,
      becoming something more like them and less like himself. Agarim of old would
      merely exist, content in the ways of the wolf.
    %p
      Vulfen are the children of Agarim in the second Wolf Age. As the Shadow came
      over Near, they multiplied and encroached upon lands settled by people. They
      even crossed the frozen sea to the northern continent.
    %p
      No creature could resist Vulfen during the shadow night. Humans cast down their
      totems and took to worshipping Agarim, the oldest of them all. Vulfen did not
      think to own the land like humans thought, but they did not think to allow the
      humans to own it, either; human villages were mercilessly culled by the Vulfen,
      ensuring that none would grow powerful enough to pose a danger to Agarim’s ilk.
    %p
      Something went wrong, however, and the sun returned. Agarim’s Eye returned as
      well, but now it was pale and sickly. Gorenites came back out of their holes
      with the sun and started building and farming again. They even captured Vulfen
      and tamed them.
    %p
      Taming was something of a revelation to Vulfen, who feared the condition
      greatly, thinking that it made them slow and stupid. In time they learned to be
      suspicious of humans and only interact with them through fetches, people taken
      from their villages to serve a Vulfen pack.
    %p
      In time the land Vulfen would not allow people to own came to be known as
      “Vulfland” to the humans up north. The land humans could hold against the
      Vulfen was known as “Jošland”, for its apocryphal founder.
    %p
      Vulfen do not have religion, but they do have dreams: when all packs dream
      together, that dream is known to be true to all. Agarim swallowing the sun and
      Vulfen ruling the earth – this dream was known to all Vulfen of the last
      generation, and the generation before that.
    %p
      Today Vulfen are uncertain: is this the second Wolf Age? Some claim to know the
      dream of Agarim, but as many as have dreams have abandoned their packs to live
      with humans, dreaming of nothing. The sun is weaker than ever, but nobody knows
      if it is weak enough.
