    This movement gathers together material that found no place in the other
    portions of the book. These are border peoples of Near, ones that have not been
    so important to our play so far.
  %p
    There is also a series of scenarios and highly situational crunch environments
    for your entertainment and edification in how to make your own.
  %p
    This material has only been playtested minimally or not at all as far as I
    know; it’s wild, full of ideas and unregimented. Approach and make friends at
    your own risk.

        Typical Ability SPECIALIZATIONS for Oranides include herding, farming, knowing
        the waterholes, fighting during the rains, understanding Kalderon,
        understanding traditionalists, finding the Wedge constellation, recognizing
        rain clouds, rowing, political pay-outs, inciting crowds, protecting caravans,
      %p
        Typical Pool CONDITIONING for Oranides involves getting lost on the plains,
        participating in Kalderonite orgies, having born under auspicious stars.
      %p
        Typical Ability ENHANCEMENTS for Oranides originate in classical training
        manuals, lover’s tokens, initiations, traveling to Qek and back.
      %p.last
        Typical EQUIPMENT for Oranides depends: tribesmen have bows, initiation
        regalia, horses, spears, staffs, herds, hero bands, musical instruments, bark
        writing. Tribeswomen have farming tools, pottery, initiation regalia,
        storehouses, homes, drainage systems, covens, musical instruments, scrolls.
        Kalderonites have swords, armor, spears, draped clothing, rings, architecture,
        streets, sewers, ships, books, politicians, military units, trade caravans.
    %p
      Far to the north of Maldor the ancient, west of the untamed Qek lie the plains
      of Oran. Bound by mountain chains twice and edged by the Sea of Teeth, the
      plains open up in slowly rolling grasslands that range from the southern
      deserts through the trackless steppe to the lush savannah of the northern
      reaches.
    %p
      The plains of Oran are the home to an indigenous culture of horse nomads,
      stargazers and falcon-wielders, people whose sparse transhumance belies their
      love of the sky. Amidst this Spartan existence lies Kalderon, the great urban
      hub of the Skironite lands, the last colony of ancient Maldor. The civilized
      and primitive are tangled in an impossible relationship on the plains.
    %p
      Orania is an isolated land that has little to do with the rest of Near. Few
      foreign ships dock on the Boulder River banks today. Their overland trade with
      the Gorenite highlands sustains a fascinating hybrid culture that turns inward,
      content with its relative geographical isolation. Once there were two peoples
      here, now nobody knows if the Kalderonite can be separated from the Skironite.

        %a#the-lost-colony{:name => "the-lost-colony"} The Lost Colony
      %p
        The Oran of today is dominated by the great city-state of Kalderon, a great hub
        that attracts the tribes from its farthest reaches. Even the primitives from
        Qek and Khale come to see Kalderon the Great with its walls the like of which
        are all but unknown in the northern Near of today.
      %p
        The myth of General Kalder and the birth of the city is a matter of great
        national pride to the citizens even as the city itself grows dry and vacant
        with the lack of trade. The patrons and free men of the city live among the
        signs of the past, carrying a great awareness of their Maldorian heritage. In
        many ways they consider themselves more of the Empire than the far Maldor
        itself and its feudal, lawless present.
      %p
        The continuing existence of Kalderon after the Time of Shadow is predicated on
        the support and cooperation of the barbarian tribes of the waste. This is the
        wisdom of Kalder, the mythic founder of the colony: Maldor would win this land
        not with force of arms, but by proving itself to the tribes. The Skyfire cast
        the original vision aside, but Kalder is still credited with the survival of
        the colony where others perished: the natives proved just as instrumental to
        the survival of the colony as the colony became to the survival of the tribes.

        %p
          As the back story suggests, Kalderonites are essentially Maldorite culturally.
          It’s not a bad idea to assume that they have essentially similar crunch, except
          for the feudal social material Maldor proper has developed. For example,
          Kalderonite legions are definitely MILITARY UNITS in the Maldorian sense.
        %p
          Note that the Servitors (as per the SECRET OF THE SERVITORS) are visible in
          Skironite lands at night; anybody can make a STARGAZING (R) or ASTROLOGY (R)
          check to have the Story Guide pick planets equal to the check result that the
          character manages to spot.

            %dt Law (R)
            %dd
              Kalderon is one of the last societies in Near to be truly ruled by a civil law
              that is punctually followed in drawing the line between right and wrong. This
              Ability is useful in knowing the old imperial laws and applying them to cases,
              although SPEAK (R) is still needed to make the case convincingly.
            %dt Diplomacy (R)
            %dd
              “The art of living with others” is a cornerstone of Oranide life. The
              magistrates of Kalderon put great stock to understanding their friends and
              enemies, and inventing means of avoiding needless strife. Life is difficult
              enough as it is.
            %dt Secret of the Senator
            %dd
              The character has been voted into the Kalderonite Senate, which enables him to
              use SPEAK (R), DIPLOMACY (R) and other appropriate Abilities to control the
              arms and treasury of the state. As long as he remains human, each scene during
              which he makes an Ability check to participate in the Senate he has to check
              RESIST (R) against his own check; failure compels him to lose a piece of human
              crunch (regaining Advances) or gain a piece of crunch from another species
              appropriate to the character (going into Advance debt if necessary). The gained
              crunch has to be the mandatory Secret of the species (changing the character’s
              species permanently) if he already has more Advances invested into the species
              than his RESIST (R) check’s value.
            %dt Secret of the Magister
            %dd
              The character is an officer of the Kalderonite civil service. The powers of his
              office are termed in a senatorial degree, which is created by a LAW (R) check
              made into an Effect that describes the office and is maintained however long
              the magister needs those powers. The character can draw bonus dice equal to a
              suitable office’s value to issues of authority, but not against a higher-valued
              applicable office. He can only be prosecuted for his actions in office by
              stripping the office from him, which requires overcoming the Effect. In fact,
              casting the office in doubt would probably be necessary to get a Kalderonite to
              even manhandle the magister, such is their respect for the civil service and
              the laws protecting it. Career civil servants often hold multiple offices
              simultaneously, shedding and obtaining them freely; the player decides when to
              allow the Effects to lapse and when to seek new ones.
            %dt Secret of the Office
            %dd
              When the character’s office aligns with a Servitor present in the sky, he does
              not need to make a check in fulfilling his duty at all: he can just use the
              value of his office directly. Cost: 1 Pool appropriate to the replaced Ability.
              Requirement: SECRET OF THE MAGISTER
            %dt Secret of Citizen (district)
            %dd
              The character knows a specific district of Kalderon very well. He can use its
              power for the citizen cost and gains a bonus die on any checks where knowing
              the district is useful. Other characters can enter the district and use it as
              well once at least one character in the game has this Secret, but only by
              paying the full cost.
            %dt Bazaar District
            %dd
              The Bazaar of Kalderon is a debilitated and lazy place, but it is large and
              full of old, slow merchandise. Characters can buy almost any equipment here: a
              BARTER (I) check establishes the quality of item the character can afford. The
              details of the item are established in half by the player and the Story Guide.
              Characters can also sell equipment: the character regains the Advance and gains
              a free Effect equal to equipment quality in trade. Citizen Cost: 2 REASON if
              buying a magical item. Full Cost: VIGOR equal to the number of Bazaar citizens
              in the game to enter or leave. Citizen cost and 1 INSTINCT per Imbuement on
              bought items.
            %dt Knife Street District
            %dd
              Life is cheap on the alleys around the Street of Knives and Knaves. Any Harm
              caused here is increased one level, to a maximum of MORTAL (6). Making any
              Ability check costs; characters who can’t pay in Pool pay as Harm equal to the
              Pool debt. Citizen Cost: no cost. Full Cost: VIGOR equal to the number of Knife
              Street citizens in the game to enter or exit the district. 1 INSTINCT per
              check.
            %dt Senatorial District
            %dd
              Most senators of Kalderon move in to live near the Senate; it almost seems that
              they live in there. Characters in the district can speak to senators and use
              the SECRET OF THE MAGISTER. Citizen Cost: 1 INSTINCT per social check. Full
              Cost: VIGOR equal to the number of Senatorial citizens in the game to enter or
              exit the district. Citizen cost and 1 REASON per check.
            %dt Secret of the Lictor
            %dd
              The character has a bought, assigned or inherited right to carry weapons in
              Kalderon. He can enter or leave any district brought into the game for no extra
              cost.

              compromise. 5xp: The inhumanity of the Senate comes clearly to the fore.

              The character is a Tribune of the popular assembly in Kalderon, responsible for
              safeguarding the will of the people against excesses of the Senate. 1xp: The
              will of the people is discussed. 2xp: The population assembles. 5xp: Benefit
              from your position. Buyoff: Relinquish your position.
            %dt Key of the Constitution
            %dd
              The character genuinely believes in the Kalderonite social order. The
              constitution itself is not a written document, it’s “Customs of Our Ancestors”,
              a set of precedents. 1xp: Speak about a constitutional principle. 3xp: Defend
              the constitution against debasement. Buyoff: Betray constitutional principles.
            %dt Key of the City
            %dd
              Kalderon is, all things considered, likely to be the greatest city remaining in
              the world. 1xp: A scene happens in Kalderon. 2xp: A new thing in Kalderon is
              revealed. 5xp: A new district is brought into the game. Buyoff: Leave Kalderon
            %dt Key of the Lictor
            %dd
              The character has a duty as a peace officer in the city. 1xp: Interfere in a

              committed.

        %a#venerable-senate{:name => "venerable-senate"} Venerable Senate
      %p
        Kalderon is ruled by a senate of elders, which votes for its own replenishment
        (only citizens are eligible) and imbues magisters to deal with individual
        matters. The power of the senate is reined in by popular assembly, which may
        convene at will and set binding decrees for the senate. The senators themselves
        are lofty figures rarely seen in broad daylight, a custom which developed
        during the Shadow. As the story would have it, the senate consists almost
        exclusively of elves, which are adored and feted by the city at large. In truth
        a majority starts on their way to goblinhood as soon as they are elected.
      %p
        The modern Kalderon exists in a precarious balance between the tribes,
        displaying the majesty of old Maldor and sharing freely of the literary
        heritage in the hopes of pacifying the tribes and affirming its alliances time
        and again. The Legion of Kalderon is a superior fighting force, but it pales in
        numbers to the hordes that ride the plains.
      %p
        Recently the Ammeni houses have opened trade enclaves in Kalderon to sell
        slaves and buy metals. The heirs of old Maldor have their differences, and the
        patricians of the city are undecided; the City has been isolationist in nature
        ever since the Darkness receded, satisfying itself with unifying Orania into
        something resembling a nation. Should this change, nobody knows how far the
        untested navy and oldfashioned Legion could cast their shadow.

      %p
        The tribes of Oran, although split into a multitude, share a distinct heritage,
        lifestyle and beliefs. Although the tribes are many and self-governing, they
        mostly live in peace – a tribal chief is more likely to bring his grievance to
        Kalderon, and another more likely to heed the magistrates, than either would be
        to flout the reverence the Horse Lords hold for the Sons of Kalder.
      %p
        The greatest rift between the tribes concerns, not surprisingly, Kalderon
        itself. There are those who still hold the memory of the land before the Empire
        came, and even if the Empire has long gone, Kalderon yet remains. Tribes that
        detest the influence of the newcomers in the timeless life of the plains have
        long migrated to the far inland reaches of Oran, away from the coast and easy
        reach of the legion of Kalder. While these Traditional tribes are able to know
        peace, they do not obey the laws of Kalder: caravans from Goren are attacked,
        herds taken by the strong from the weak and so on.
      %p
        What nearly all the tribes share is the way of life they call PURDA, the
        segregation. Scholars of Kalder speculate that purda originates with the Time
        of Darkness when the tribes secluded themselves in communal cave shelters,
        shelters in which they lived segregated by gender, only finally coming out to
        breed during the tail-end of the Darkness. The eunuchs claim that purda has
        always been with the tribes, making them what they are.
      %p
        What the purda means is no more or less than a full separation of the spheres
        of male and female life. The males of the tribes are nomads, warriors and Horse
        Lords, ruling the plains, while the tribe’s women and children live in villages
        or towns founded in the more fertile parts of the plains, such as at large
        cienega or river valleys. All other things are divided accordingly: herd
        animals are male issue, plants female; trade male, storage female; bright
        colors male, earth hues female; wind instruments male, stringed ones female and
        so on.
      %p
        Archery (I)
        Tribesmen supplement their diet with hunting, in which they use short bows
        suitable for horseback. Archery is also the tribe’s favourited discipline when
        they go to war; it is one of the three manly skills.

            the second manly skill.
          %dt Horsemanship (I)
          %dd
            The most important skill of a Skironite man is the care, training and riding of
            his horse. The Ability is most of the time a support for others Abilities,

            Stars are nowhere as visible as they are on the plains through the winter
            night. Knowing the stories and lore of the constellations is today a Crop Woman

            night.
          %dt Cloud-reading (R)
          %dd
            The Skironite Crop Women can read the sky for signs. The most important purpose
            for this is in predicting the weather, but other things might be seen as well:
            the Ability may replace PRAY (V) in SECRET OF PROPHECY.
          %dt Female Rites (R)
          %dd
            Skironite women give birth when the men are away, in rites that are severely
            restricted from male knowledge. The Ability is useful for knowing about
            reproduction, midwifery, contraception, abortion and treating women’s and
            children’s diseases.
          %dt Secret of Initiation
          %dd
            The character can initiate others to the various Blessings known to the tribes.
            This always requires set numbers of worshippers, testing of the initiates, a
            minimum number of initiates, some of which are left out, drawing lots, several
            tribes, specific genders, specific politics (Kalderonite or Traditionalist) and
            other such constraints. In the fiction these demands depend on the specific
            theological history of the blessing, but for our purposes the player gets to
            concoct whatever demands he wants, backing them with a PRAY (V) check. Another
            priest can override with his own offer only by beating the prior check with his
            own or by waiting until the next season. The actual initiation ritual is
            conducted with MUSIC (I). Cost: 1 REASON to establish the ritual, 2 to conduct
            it.

            The character can control the weather with an appropriate Ability check:
            STARGAZING (R) at night, CLOUD-READING (R) at day. Larger weather events can
            take several days to arrive. The check result may be used as bonus or penalty
            dice in Ability checks as appropriate. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Blue Light Blessing
          %dd
            The character masters the blue light, a fearsome Skironite combat magic. It
            gathers around him when he threshes his weapons, becoming especially potent
            when he jumps or otherwise gets off the ground. An enemy struck by the force
            suffers AGGRAVATED Harm, marked as such. Release the force at an enemy from
            afar with ARCHERY (I) or up close with WRESTLING (V). The force is completely
            drained when the character goes prone. Cost: 2 VIGOR

          %dd
            A hippogriff from the mountains is attracted by the character. It is commanded
            with FALCONRY (I) and ridden with HORSEMANSHIP (I). Keeping the hippogriff in
            service for longer than you need it makes it sad; release it, and it will
            return to you. Cost: 2 VIGOR Requirements: a prior initiation to another
            Blessing.
          %dt Blessing of the Moon
          %dd
            The character can change his sex, becoming a member of the other gender. This
            may only be attempted when the Moon is full; use BRAWLING (V) to change into a
            man, FEMALE RITES (R) to change into a woman. Cost: 2 VIGOR Requirements: a
            prior initiation to another Blessing.

      %p
        The purda is regulated by the annual transhumance, falling on different days in
        different parts of the plains. In the most traditionalist tribes the genders
        meet only twice a year: once in the fall for the culling of herds and courtship
        of the most accomplished males, once in the spring for a general revelry and
        initiation of boys into men. Even the most radical tribesmen would blush at the
        thought of coming uninvited to a women’s town outside the allotted times.
      %p
        Summer is a time of farming for the women, while men go out and take the herds
        to the distant parts of the plains, to the highlands and other inhospitable
        places. Therein the men make war on Violators and trolls, competing for the
        right of courtship in fall. The herds winter in the low country, nearer to the
        town, wherein the women spend the off-season working on crafts. Some tribes
        break purda in between the fall and spring celebrations, but most don’t.
      %p
        Sexually the Oranides are alien to most of Near: while the romantic culture,
        stories and songs of both sexes celebrates heterosexual pairing, everyday
        practice among the herdsmen and in the towns tends towards casually homosexual.
        Familial relationships in most tribes are fleeting at best; responsibility
        between genders is communal, not personal, and there is no stigma if a man
        chooses to court a different woman in a different year. Tribesmen traveling to
        other lands often find them prude and shameless at the same time.
      %p
        A distinctive part of the purda are the EUNUCHS, men riven of their genitalia
        and allowed to conduct trade and other coordination between the male and female
        communities. Another grey area in the dualism of purda are transsexuals: when
        children are initiated as adults, they are in principle free to choose an
        initiation into either gender. Such manwomen and woman-men are considered
        members of their adopted gender in all ways, sexual mores included. Even adults
        can change sex later in life, at least if they’re willing to undergo the rites
        again, including the ritual castration that man-women undergo.
      %p
        The purda separates Oranides from other peoples on a fundamental level. Even
        towards their allies in Kalderon it is the great unspoken issue: as little as
        the Kalderonites are willing to execute purda on their own are the tribesmen
        willing to let go of their tradition. All tribes, excepting the most
        traditional, have come to accept that other people have different ways:
        foreigners are usually classified and dealt with as children, free of the purda
        as they know not better.

        Aside from the laws of segregation, a central identity element for the tribes
        of Oran is their shared reverence of the Sky as a divine element. It is said
        that the great mountains are seen everywhere in Oran, and the birds that fly
        the endless sky are more numerous than the stars of old. Even as the stars have
        dimmed there isn’t a village without a Stargazer, or a herd without a
        Falconier. Unlike the Purda, this is a tradition that has been embraced whole
        by Kalderon: the tribal divinities have become the most popular of the cults in
        the secular city, and the tribal knowledge of the sky has been combined with
        Kalderonite astrology.
      %p
        Unlike all other elements of life, the reverence for the sky crosses the purda,
        perhaps because the sky rites are such a large aspect of the biannual
        celebrations. Crop Women call to the sky for rains or warmth while Horse Lords
        sing of destiny; both use the same tunes. This sky ritual magic is called
        BLESSINGS; they are like normal Secrets, except gaining them can be a bit
        arduous. Blessings are gained among the Skironites in various communal rites,
        the most powerful and oldest of which require the participation of both
        genders, if not multiple prior initiations for the initiate; only the most able
        should be eligible, but in Kalderonite tribes it is often the most influential
        who are initiated.
      %p
        A central tenet of the Oranide religion concerns the coming of the mythical
        beast, HIPPOGRIFF; it is believed that this cross-breed of eagle and horse
        comes from its mountain lair at the call of the true song of the Horse Lord.
        Flying is considered a holy act by the Oranides, flying with the winged horse
        doubly so. The greatest heroes are supposed to fly over the Roof, to land in
        the Great Steppe beyond, the ancestral homeland of all Oranides.

        I’ve never played! When I last was in Kalderon, I didn’t have all this stuff to
        play with. Like, for instance, Purda – nothing even close to that, we just had
        lots of classical statuary the nomads had a tendency for breaking. And insofar
        as I know, others have not had the full majesty of Kalderon to tool around with
        either, so we’re breaking completely new ground here.

        Kalderon is like Constantinople, a great remainder of a greater culture. I
        really adore it out there on the western edge of the Sea of Teeth with my
        settingdesign senses; the northern Near is so sparse of culture without it, and
        the Ammeni need a counterbalance of some sort in the area to get a good sea
        battle going. This way there’s some place where the Qek and Khaleans and such
        can meet in a tavern without the tavern being in the middle of a jungle
        somewhere.
      %p
        The political process of Kalderon is complex, dehumanizing and essentially
        modern. This does not mean that it is necessarily evil: not only can a
        politician hold onto his morality by being willing to curtail his inculcation
        into the system, but even were he to turn into another politician, that implies
        nothing about the nobility of his goals.
      %p
        A Skironite character, on the other hand, faces two obvious questions: his
        relationship to Kalderon, whose gates are never closed, and his relationship to
        the Purda. The questions are related, but not entirely.
      %p
        Winning Blessings is a necessary step in becoming a Skironite hero, but that
        might require accomplishments or political influence itself, depending on the
        nature of the given tribe’s priests. The similarities with Kalderonite politics
        are not incidental.

      The great island fortress of Inselburg lies midway between Near and the

      People of the scattered Vadenite archipelago are independent to a fault,

      defense against anything mainlanders of the modern era could throw against
      them. In the old High Seas Fleet they have the tools to elevate or subjugate
      the coastlines of Near. The only issue is how and when this power might be
      used.

      %p
        The Vadenite archipelago was colonized by the Empire early due to its important
        position as a supply base and military installation in the southwestern waters
        of Near. With time the installations on the island were enlarged; both the
        Hamodine wars and ocean exploration efforts initiated by the celestial
        bureaucracy warranted substantial improvements to the naval capacities of the
        Inselburg fortress, making it the largest operative nexus of imperial naval
        activities.
      %p
        At the time of the Skyfire, however, Inselburg had already been a decade into a
        rebellion against the Empire. The original reasons for the rebellion are
        largely forgotten outside the islands; the islanders themselves cite a palace
        coup that closed off oceanic exploration, corruption of the imperial
        bureaucracy, and their unquenched thirst for freedom. The reasons for the
        original betrayal of the naval command, which made the rebellion possible,
        remain a mystery and a popular topic of stories.
      %p
        When the Skyfire appeared and the world trembled at the omen, the Vadian
        islanders interpreted the growing glow favorably for their hard-pressed, waning
        rebellion. The attitude is held to this day: anything lesser than the Skyfire
        could not have destroyed Absolon’s Empire, they say.

            Vadenite islands are in many places close enough to see each other, or at least

            used to compose and interpret these messages, to recognize who sends a

          %dt Secret of Magistery
          %dd
            The character knows how to create COLLEGIUMS by investing holy vows that bind.
            The vows are created by one or more PRAY (V) checks made into Effects which
            determine the power of the vows and the consequences for breaking them. The
            collegium is created by choosing a Secret the character knows, renaming it
            appropriately, perhaps changing some Abilities it requires and reducing its
            Pool cost by one point per vow connected to it. (The vows can also provide
            bonus or penalty dice as appropriate to Secrets that do not have a Pool cost.)
            The magister can now teach the new Secret to his collegiates without caring for
            any requirements the Secret used to have. The magister can have the collegial
            magic strike anybody who knows the Secret with the power of the Effect to cause
            the consequences indicated by the vows to befell him, but only once per Effect
            per target. The target may RESIST (R) the magic. This does not expend the
            collegial Effect; it (and the discount on the Secret) remains as long as the
            magister continues to maintain the collegium.

            The Skyfire Cult is native collegium of Inselburg. It believes that the Skyfire
            was a fortunate event that saved the world from tyranny; Skyfire cultists tend
            to argue for liberty even at pain of death in the Congress. The first degree
            initiates learn to shape “skyfire”: the initiate’s touch is sufficient to

            Fleet patrols. The initiate can use a compass or other divining tools to find

            Star Captain Brotherhood in Congress. The initiate can fly on the slightest
            winds. Cost: 1 INSTINCT (1 vow)
          %dt Secret of the Eclectic
          %dd
            The character is skilled at predicting and avoiding bad magics. He needs a
            metal staff and gloves to do his trick. A successful PRAYER (V) check transfers
            an incoming magic’s power through the staff into the earth, the sea or into
            another person, depending on where the eclectic roots his staff. Success levels
            equal to the eclectic’s check are diverted from the opposing magician’s check
            before it reaches its target. This trick suffers a circumstance penalty die
            against Three-Corner magic and two against any other magics, except collegial
            arts of Inselburg. Cost: 2 REASON
          %dt Secret of High Seas Fleet
          %dd
            The character has been taught how to sail the black ships, and he is thus
            capable of using his appropriate Abilities for the purpose. The ships and their
            equipment are a technological aberration at present time, so operating them
            ranges from difficult to impossible without in-depth tutelage in various
            applied sciences. Characters with this training may consider any High Seas
            Fleet equipment to have an appropriate EXPERT IMBUEMENT for free.
          %dt Demolition (R)
          %dd
            Fleet crews in Inselburg are trained to handle the black ship cannons and other
            explosives; specialist marines are trained as grenadiers as well.
          %dt Explosive Imbuement
          %dd
            This single-use imbuement can be used with a DEMOLITION (R) check. One
            equipment rating in the equipment gains a +2 to its value for this roll;
            however, if the check is opposed, the character suffers an additional Harm
            equal to the check difference (towards his actual check, not the equipment
            rating). The imbuement is removed after use.
          %dt Black Sail Imbuement
          %dd
            The black ship sails are superior to modern solutions, being usually the only
            propulsion such a ship uses. The ship with this rigging can compete or overcome
            galley arrangements in most winds, especially when it has room to maneuver. It
            has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE against galleys on open sea when it comes to maneuvers or
            long journeys; the black ship chooses whether to engage and how in those
            conditions.
          %dt Black Hull Imbuement
          %dd
            The larger black ships are much taller than most modern ones, except perhaps
            for the giant galleys of Ammeni. This is not entirely beneficial in shallow
            waters, but in close engagement it makes boarding action impossible for an
            unprepared enemy. The ship may also have an unlimited number of other
            imbuements thanks to its size.
          %dt Cannon Imbuement
          %dd
            The black ship has cannons. There is very little that lesser ships can do
            against them at range: when the cannons are used with DEMOLITION (R) (or
            COMMAND (I) if directing fire for a battery), normal Ability checks cannot be
            used to resist them at all. An opposing ship or coastal target needs magic or
            other equivalent leverage to defend or counterattack meaningfully, otherwise a
            simple check suffices for the cannons. Cost: 1 Vigor per shot
          %dt Key of Liberty
          %dd
            The character believes in liberty at any cost. 1xp: Enjoy your liberty. 3xp:
            Refute an authority. Buyoff: Compromise on your principle.
          %dt Key of the Fleet
          %dd
            The High Seas Fleet concerns the character. 1xp: Discuss the fleet. 2xp:
            Prevent the usage of the fleet. 5xp: Use the fleet for something. Buyoff: Allow
            a ship to fall in strange hands.
          %dt Collegial Key (specify)
          %dd
            The character’s collegium has a solid collegial spirit. 1xp: Socialize with

        The islands were incredibly poor after the Shadow, all but the largest being
        scoured clean by the cataclysm. Inselburg itself cannot hold the steadily
        climbing population, however, so the most adventurous families moved early to
        stake claim to the best islands. Typically a family would be careful to remain
        in contact with the fortress residents through close familial relationships
        with those remaining inside.
      %p
        Today Inselburg is a convoluted decentralized democracy stretching several days
        of good sailing from the fortress proper. The individual islands are
        self-governing: originally this was because a single family would live on one
        island, later because no agreement on common government could be established.
        Each island sends a representative to the annual Congress at Inselburg; the
        most important decisions concern voting for Prefects who maintain the fortress,
        allocating desirable living space inside Inselburg proper and deciding on the
        deployment and captaincies of the High Seas Fleet.
      %p
        Trade and socializing have the archipelago bustling with activity through the
        summer. Disagreements are common as well, but trouble is handled very
        courteously; ostracism of community is a threat, and the elected Prefects of
        the fortress can bar entrance to trouble-makers at will. As honorable marriages
        and other celebrations are held exclusively at the fortress, being barred from
        entering is a heavy threat to honorable islanders.
      %p
        Still, what most holds the people of Inselburg together and on the islands may
        not be mutual love and fascination with the sparse livelihood: the heritage of
        the rebellion weights heavily on their conscience, and as long as the High Seas
        Fleet remains, it defines the nation as surely as any ruler.

        Inselburg proper arches over five closely-spaced islets. In between the cliffs
        lie dark entrances into the bowels of the stone fortress, entrances usable by
        the largest of ships. In these cave harbors the imperial High Seas Fleet
        wintered, safe from the savage southern winter storms. And there they yet
        remain, those that have not succumbed to age.
      %p
        The ships of the line are large, technologically superior to anything modern
        Near knows. They have multiple masts and complex rigging, and no oars, for they
        are far too large to move about with mere muscle. The ships are too tall to
        board from all but the largest galleys, and what must be the most frightening,
        they have slots for cannons that belch smoke, fire and lead.
      %p
        The ships of the High Seas Fleet are black from tar-based paints they are
        treated with to prevent aging of the wood. The Black Ships, as they are known
        to outsiders, are a matter of great fear and superstition on the Ocean. The
        only major engagement of the fleet a few years ago resulted in a crushing
        defeat for the first son of an Ammeni house; only two ships of the fleet were
        mobilized then, and both returned without losses.
      %p
        What the High Seas Fleet has done to Inselburg cannot be underestimated: the
        solid fishermen and traders of the islands do not know what to do with what
        they have, but they are utterly committed to preserving the legacy their
        forebears fought for. Every family sends a son to learn the sailing skills
        required to crew a black ship; every woman of the islands knows how to weave
        the thick sails used in the salty ocean breezes.  Regardless, a certain awe and
        superstition surrounds the ships on the otherwise indigent islands.
      %p
        A major reason for the Inselburg Congress, and a primary responsibility for the
        Prefects, is the safeguarding of the High Seas Fleet from sabotage, larceny and
        coup d’état. A congress action is required to crew and send out the ships,
        except for two that are kept in permanent readiness by the Prefects. So
        reluctant are the islanders to risk or misuse the Fleet that they actually
        organize a merchant flotilla out of lesser boats and newly built ships to
        reduce the usage of the Fleet. Even knowledge of where the black ships come
        from is not easy to come by in most parts of Near.

        The islanders are socially very conformist and proper, to such a degree that it
        is not unknown for a family to oust members who bring shame to them. The only
        exception to this comes in the activity of so called COLLEGIUMS, cults and
        guilds islanders support. Absolute freedom of thought is prized in Inselburg,
        perhaps as a compensation for the arid and routine life they have to endure.
        While people are expected to follow the social code in public, in private they
        can do almost anything they like without censure; rather, anybody trying to
        blackmail another for their private choices would surely be shunned themselves.
      %p
        While some of the collegiums are professional in nature, most are essentially
        mystery cults: prospective members joining a collegium (which often happens at
        various festivals at the fortress) are promised hidden lore and various
        concrete benefits for joining the collegium. Collegiums do not necessarily
        require much of their members, but revealing their secrets to outsiders is a
        major offense punished by cult magics, more or less effectual.
      %p
        Membership in a collegium is exclusive unless the collegium MAGISTER gives
        permission for multiple initiation. Holding a magisterium is considered a
        public office due some respect, as many of the collegiums are important for the
        everyday life of the islands. For example, the Star Captain Brotherhood has
        cult magic of such importance to navigation that membership is considered
        practically mandatory for anybody wishing to captain a ship of the High Seas
        Fleet.
      %p
        One of the most unfortunate crimes in Inselburg is the breaking of collegial
        vows an initiate takes when entering the collegium. A legendary stormcrow
        figure in Inselburgian lore is the collegial ECLECTIC, a magician who steals
        collegial secrets and avoids the retributive curses with magics of his own.
        While breaking collegial vows is not a civil crime in Inselburg, the eclectic
        is shunned: his magic turns the retribution directed against him towards
        others, causing storms, poisoning of the earth and worse for those associating
        with him.

        Greek city-state, Protestant Germans and Switzerland.
      %p
        The real mileage I get from Inselburg is as a sort of world police. The Black
        Ships can show up almost everywhere, and the Inselburgians are considerably
        decent compared to many larger nations in Near. When it seems that a player
        character has burned all his bridges in the focal point of the campaign, a
        Black Ship might be the ticket to a new life if he’s willing to cooperate at
        all. The beauty if it is, of course, that the Inselburgians are also pretty
        impotent when you get over those cannons.
      %p
        If Maldor and Ammeni (and some parts of Old Goren) are considered comparatively
        civilized next to the various barbarian cultures of Near, then Inselburg can be
        counted in that group as well. It is, however, a different sort of animal in
        this era of warlords and empires.

        Serving the Fleet is such an overbearing consideration in Inselburg that

        the whole country.

        The political system of the fortress is in reality a secret, unacknowledged
        battleground for the various collegiums and their magisters, some of which
        wield the collegiate vows as threats against their own members. The collegiate

      Most ships sailing the seas of Near hail from Ammeni or Inselburg, or perhaps
      Maldor. Fearsome pirates hail from Khale and Jošland, but none are more feared
      and mysterious than the Feyan rebel ships slashing at the coasts of Maldor and
      Ammeni. They are rarely witnessed, even more seldom warded against and always
      lost to the mists of the high seas when pursued.
    %p
      Few know where the islands of Pere-di-Fey are, for they follow the tides. Among
      the vagabonds of old Maldor flow a hundred stories of the blessed archipelago
      and its miracles. The common saying has it that neither the rich nor the
      powerful are welcome on the isles, which come only to those of humility and
      soft heart. Escaped plantation slaves of Ammeni, homeless peons from Maldor and
      even refugees from Tiserian purges of the far west seek their way towards the
      eastern coastline and the places where the islands are told to appear when the
      moon is full or when the sun sets in the midsummer’s eve. For many this hope of
      Pere-di-Fey is their last, best hope.
    %p
      The truth of the matter is somewhat more disappointing. The barren islands are
      sorely overpopulated by the burgeoning crowds of escapees, whose hospitality is
      being strained by every new arrival. Life on the moving islands is not an easy
      one even for the natives, and with fresh bitterness flooding the islands every
      time they happen close to the shore, there is ample support for the most cruel
      piracy, looting and murder of the continental masters.

        The isles of Pere-di-Fey range from large, forested main isles to smaller
        islets and flat rocks jutting out from the sea. In the times before the Shadow
        the islands were far in the Eastern Ocean, so far so that ships from Near or
        the Hamouadi Empire only seldom visited the archipelago. People called Kairakau
        had always inhabited the islands, but few cared about them. Most important
        trade article of the isles were the colorful, varied crustaceans and coral
        growths harvested by the people.
      %p
        When the Skyfire came, the Feyan islands shook. When its baleful light grew,
        Kairakau grew worried. Some started having dreams, many left as prophets spoke
        of destruction that would wash over the islands. The prophets remained,
        however, convinced that they would be spared.
      %p
        When the Skyfire disappeared and the land shook, great waves washed over the
        coasts of Near. Pere-di-Fey in the deep ocean fared better than most places,
        but when the sun dimmed and winked out, the few people left were sure to
        perish.
      %p
        However, all was not lost: Kairakau prophets, now called LAND-SPEAKERS, spoke
        to the islands themselves and had them open for the people so they could
        shelter themselves inside.  Hundreds wintered in the moist recesses of the
        Feyan isles through the Shadow, guided by the land-speakers. Most of the
        islands sank to the bottom of the Ocean to wait out the Shadow.
      %p
        After the Moon rose, nothing was the same for the Feyans. The islands
        themselves had awakened, and were now on the move. The large islands drifted
        slowly, almost imperceptibly. The smaller islets would frolic in moonlight,
        raising foam, but keeping close to the larger ones. Some, unmoving, were left
        behind, like dead carcasses of mighty beasts.
      %p
        Through the years the archipelago has zigzagged over the Ocean, ranging from
        the subtropics to the frigid reaches. Where the islands once slept now blows
        the Torrid Clime, and they show no signs of returning. To the contrary, the
        general direction of the migration has over the generations been towards the
        southeast, towards Near; today individual isles may sometimes be seen from the
        continent, and the greater ones get closer every year. Only in the Southern Sea
        and the Sea of Teeth are the islands never sighted.

            processes, and to support attempts at farming plants or sealife. It’s mostly a

            a mean accuracy, mean enough to make almost all Talalag retreat. This Ability

            can’t be a culture another player character is from, unless the other player
            accedes to it. In addition, the character always regains one extra Pool point
            when refreshing Pools with another refugee; this point comes on top of the

            The hybrid culture of Pere-di-Fey has many superstitions from all over the
            world, some of which are actually true to a degree. When the character decides
            to take a superstition seriously for the moment, the player can create an
            Effect out of a REACT (I) check to make note of it. The Effect can later be
            used as either bonus or penalty dice according to the superstition, even
            against the character himself; the Story Guide decides when the Effect is
            activated.

            Whatever it is, the Talalag holds a point of ICHOR, which can be spent as a

        The Kairakau were few after the Shadow, but their numbers started climbing
        quickly once the landspeakers figured out how the islands could be compelled to
        make a beeline towards Near, a direction they were keen to take anyway. The
        islanders needed materials and knowledge if they were to make their bare-blown
        home habitable once again; they were willing to provide homes to those who
        would bring these things with them.
      %p
        Kairakau had always valued hospitality as a virtue above others, so they were
        only too happy to take in wretched refugees from the wars and calamity of the
        slowly shattering continental empire. The first legends of Pere-di-Fey date
        from the first generation after the Shadow. After the Feyans, now a mixed stock
        of natives and mixed refugees of a dozen nations, gained a few ships of their
        own, they could keep in regular contact with the continental world regardless
        of where their island homes went.
      %p
        Today the islands are densely inhabited by the discarded wretches of all the
        nations of Near. Many fish, some farm, some practice crafts, but most stay on
        their ships and engage in everything from trade to piracy to sustain
        themselves. The islands provide a point of contact for the crews, an
        opportunity to repair ships and trade for necessities. There are even towns on
        the larger, semi-stabile islands far out on the Ocean.
      %p
        The Feyans have an adventurous and romantic reputation in many parts of Near
        due to their famed hospitality and “steal from the rich, give to the poor”
        stylings. In other places they are feared and hated for the inhuman savagery of
        some pirate crews. Each crew is only responsible to their captain, and the
        captains answer to no-one, so the Feyans have dozens of faces out in the world.

        The Kairakau were taught by the land-speakers through the Year of Shadow to
        respect the islands that sheltered them, the HALATU; land-speakers believed
        them to be living creatures of a distant world. The Feyans also learned of the
        TALALAG, the crustacean creatures long used for food, jewelry and tools on the
        islands. According to the priests, the Talalag were sibling creatures to the
        islands themselves, coming in a multitude of forms and sizes, all of which
        helped the islands thrive as living biospheres. The most holy of the
        land-speakers became bonded to the islands when they took the Talalag into
        themselves, becoming a part of the true ecosystem of the islands.
      %p
        Today all religions and philosophies of Near are practiced in Pere-di-Fey, but
        the most respect is still accorded to the land-speakers and Talal-captains,
        people who willingly provide a home to small Talalag in their own bodies. These
        symbionts range in size from a finger’s width to as large as a limb. They look
        weird, colorful and exotic, ugly by continental standards, scary to sea people
        who know what they mean. Talal-hosts gain many talents from their symbiosis,
        such as a protection from drowning.
      %p
        However, they cannot leave the Ocean, as the Talalag die if they dry out
        completely. Often refugees are only accorded respect once they prove their
        commitment to the Pere-di-Fey by taking on a symbiont.

        %p
          The Talalag symbionts are like Secrets, except that they can be taken on and
          shed with a simple LANDSPEECH (I) check made by the character or an attendant.
          However, symbiosis is physically painful and straining as the symbiont learns
          to live with the character: he suffers a Harm equal to the size of the symbiont
          each time one is attached or removed.
        %p
          The symbiont’s SIZE is a simple free Effect attached to the symbiont Secret.
          The Story Guide may assume that most symbionts are in the 1–2 range, unless the
          character makes a point of looking for a particularly large Talalag of the
          appropriate type. A larger size makes for a more powerful symbiont, but it’s
          also more distinctive and straining, and more dangerous when it is removed. The
          group might well assume that the character’s Harm track sets a practical
          maximum for his number of symbionts; having more and larger symbionts than he
          can absorb the Harm from would mean that there’s more Talalag than human in the
          symbiosis, and the character would die were he ever forcibly separated from his
          symbionts.
        %p
          The Talalag are powered by the character’s Pools, but most of them cannot
          sustain themselves directly: instead, they feed on ICHOR POOLS. The simplest
          symbionts help the character transform his Pools into ichor, which is stored by
          the symbiont. The player can track the ichor Pools just like he does with the
          character’s own Pools, and transform one into the other at his convenience.
        %p
          There are four different ichors in the Talalag ecology: the RED and YELLOW are
          the most common; they might be understood as roughly analogical to the
          difference between vegetative and animal life, were a character to examine the
          ecology of the isles from that viewpoint. BLACK and GREEN are more rare and
          specialized, at least in Pere-di-Fey. I use three types of symbionts: the base
          ones that provide ichors, simple ones that spend one type and big ones that
          require a continuous supply of one type and some of another.
        %p
          The various powers characters gain from symbionts are used in conflict with
          appropriate Ability checks. Typically this would be LAND- SPEECH (R) when the
          issue is understanding Talalag and USE SYMBIONT (V) when it’s an issue of being
          used to the new senses or whatever the character has to deal with.
        %p
          The Talalag themselves can be depicted as animal-like characters by the Story
          Guide when appropriate; some are large enough to interact with. They’d probably
          have an ichor-based biology, Passive Abilities and so on, but using normal
          animal rules is close enough for our purposes here.

            %dt Secret of Symbiosis
            %dd
              The character has researched the Talalag and their capabilities for symbiosis;
              a successful LAND-SPEECH (I) check can be used to recognize different Talalags
              and their needs as symbionts; the character can find any size of symbiont up to
              his check result by trawling the islands. A check can also be used when the
              symbiosis is commenced or ended to guide the Talalag and reduce the Harm it
              causes by the check result. Cost: 1 INSTINCT to reduce Harm.
            %dt Vigor Symbiont
            %dd
              The character can breathe water. He can also transform VIGOR into any color of
              ICHOR. The symbiont stores a maximum of its size in ichor at once, and can
              store multiple colors. The symbiont dies if the character doesn’t submerge in
              the ocean every day. Cost: 1 VIGOR plus the number to transform into one color
              of ichor, to a maximum of the symbiont’s size.
            %dt Instinct Symbiont
            %dd
              The character needs one tenth of the amount of food and sleep others do. He can
              also transform INSTINCT into GREEN or RED ICHOR. The symbiont stores a maximum
              of its size in ichor at once, and can store either color. The symbiont dies if
              the character doesn’t submerge in the ocean every day. Cost: 1 INSTINCT plus
              the number to transform into one color of ichor, to a maximum of the symbiont’s
              size.
            %dt Reason Symbiont
            %dd
              The character ignores moderate ranges of temperature and pressure, such as
              those encountered in the ocean. He can also transform REASON into BLACK or
              YELLOW ICHOR. The symbiont stores a maximum of its size in ichor at once, and
              can store either color. The symbiont dies if the character doesn’t submerge in
              the ocean every day. Cost: 1 REASON plus the number to transform into one color
              of ichor, to a maximum of the symbiont’s size.

            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like a web of external veins growing on the
              character’s limbs. It allows him to spend RED ICHOR for bonus dice in physical
              tasks. The symbiont can only handle its size in ichor per scene. Cost: 1+ RED
              ICHOR
            %dt Neural Symbiont
            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like a series of pearl insets on the character’s
              skin. It allows him to track his absolute location like a bird, and to
              communicate with other neural symbionts over distance; I simply use a radio
              wave analogy in figuring out the details, so the communication can be listened
              by outsiders, it gets messed up by storms and so on. The symbiont can only
              handle its size in ichor per scene. Cost: 1 YELLOW ICHOR for location, 1 for
              each communication target.
            %dt Engram Symbiont
            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like subcutaneous inserts in the character’s head
              and neck. It provides him with perfect memory over the period it’s been with
              him, instant recall and considerable additional thinking speed. The character
              can replace any REASON-based Ability check result with the size value of the
              symbiont. The symbiont goes inert without a steady supply of YELLOW ICHOR,
              dying soon after. Cost: 1 YELLOW ICHOR per scene. BLACK ICHOR equal to half the
              difference (round down) between the replaced result and symbiont size.
            %dt Regenerative Symbiont
            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like coral growth in the character’s scars. It
              allows him to ignore any physical Harm up to the size of the symbiont, as it
              quickly grows alternate matter to compensate for the wound. The symbiont goes
              inert without a steady supply of RED ICHOR, dying soon after. Cost: 1 RED ICHOR
              per scene. 2 GREEN ICHOR to ignore a Harm.
            %dt Secret of Ichor Refresh
            %dd
              The character has so many symbionts that he is being influenced by the Halatu.
              He can refresh his Ichor Pools by immersing in the ocean and having an episode
              where the Talalag influence overwhelms him, for good or ill. The player can
              make a LAND-SPEECH (I) check to narrate the received visions, revelations and
              actions the character does during the refreshment himself; if the check fails
              or the player doesn’t have a particularly swinging idea of where to take the
              mysterious creatures, the Story Guide gets to narrate. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
              Requirement: the character has more symbiont size levels than Pool levels.
            %dt Secret of Growth
            %dd
              The character has learned to control his symbiont ecosystem somewhat. A
              successful LAND-SPEECH (I) check allows him to either raise or lower the size
              of a single symbiont by a step. The process takes a day or so. Cost: 3 minus
              the check result in INSTINCT.
            %dt Secret of Isle Speak
            %dd
              The character has learned to guide the Pere-di-Fey islands, and can direct them
              in the ocean. Establish a relationship with an island as a LAND-SPEECH (I)
              Effect. The player can pick any size of island, but the larger ones are very
              slow, and only the character with the best relationship towards a given island
              is actually heeded. Any relationship is considered one level weaker when the
              character wants to turn the island towards the north, and one level stronger
              when going towards the south, especially south-west. Cost: 3 INSTINCT to turn
              an island, or 1 YELLOW ICHOR with the NEURAL SYMBIONT.
            %dt Secret of Isle Fog
            %dd
              The Pere-di-Fey isles can billow out large clouds of thick, moist fog; they do
              this now and then anyway, but the character has learned how to make them do it
              on command. The character needs to have an active relationship to an island to
              try this. The fog from the smaller islands doesn’t get up to much, but the
              larger ones can hide the whole central archipelago from view. Cost: 3 INSTINCT
              to turn an island, or 1 YELLOW ICHOR with the NEURAL SYMBIONT. Requirement:
              SECRET OF ISLE SPEAK
            %dt Key of the Halatu
            %dd
              The character is a member of the landspeaker priesthood and committed to the
              welfare of the unique Halatu biosphere. 1xp: Help the biosphere. 2xp: Be helped
              in turn. 5xp: Prioritize the Halatu over human concerns, and act on it. Buyoff:
              Turn against the Halatu.
            %dt Key of Symbiosis
            %dd
              The character has feelings and thoughts that are not his own. 1xp: The Talalags

      %p
        The social structure of Pere-di-Fey is in tumult which only increases as the
        islands approach Near. Much of the population have been or still are criminals
        of various stripes, and some do not hesitate to prey on their own, especially
        in the large towns of the main islands. Even worse, any restraint they show at
        home is shed when the pirate flag is hoisted and a crew reaches its favored
        hunting waters; it is not uncommon for a crew to gather around a past wrong,
        such as slavery in the hands of the Ammeni, which they now avenge again and
        again in the most savage manner. The rewards are ample, and Feyans do not ask
        nor care where a returning ship went or what it did out on the sea.
      %p
        Respect for elders and hospitality towards the weak is a rule on the islands,
        however, which restrains the most antisocial elements for now. Increasing
        numbers of pirates gone wild have been found drowned in unspoken circumstances,
        however, as the land-speakers struggle to hold onto old Kairakau values. Many
        captains agree and make a point of welcoming the weak even while preying on the
        strong; others plot to increase their own influence in the townships on the
        expense of the Kairakau leaders.
      %p
        As things stand, it is likely that Pere-di-Fey will soon go into decline as the
        archipelago draws closer to Near. Some ships hire new crew from the continent,
        taking in outright criminals and murderers; fewer and fewer ports are willing
        to trade with the distinctive Feyan ships, as each has felt their attacks at
        least once. The Black Fleet of Inselburg is already in war with the Feyans,
        with only the elusive nature of the islands themselves protecting the
        population from a merciless revenge upon a lawless nation by ships that do not
        fear to leave the sight of the shore.
      %p
        One person sees this all and wonders; The GOVERNOR is an influential figure in
        Pere-di-Fey, so called for how they tamed the port of Felag, the ancient
        Maldorian harbor on the Heart Island. The Governor is a highly public figure,
        treating with captains and land-speakers with impunity, taking on and shedding
        symbionts as necessary. If it were up to the Governor, Pere-di-Fey would become
        a real nation and avoid a destruction in the hands of the world. He or she
        might succeed, provided that the captains could be united and the worst of the
        crews brought to justice.

        Never played this stuff, I’m just writing it down for future use. The closest I
        got was a player character who claimed to come from these isles, but I hadn’t
        even written any crunch for them then. The idea is originally Josh’s, I just
        wrote mechanics for it and honed some fluff. Do let us know if you get around
        to using this.
      %p
        I imagine that the isles could be useful exploratory content of the sort a

          I don’t know about the reader, but my own first reaction to something like the
          Talalag symbionts in roleplaying games is always that the price to pay will be
          horrible. It’s just part of the genre, scientists never get to inject alien DNA
          and find out that hey, lucky us, superpowers without consequences.
        %p
          I’m saying this because I explicitly did not do this story here. I left it
          intentionally open, and even while I could have, I didn’t put in rules for how
          gaining too many symbionts makes the character into an alien zombie. The player
          will explicitly have to welcome that option through suitable Secrets, and even
          then I’d find it pretty simplistic to just assume that the Talalag all want the
          atmosphere to burn or something. Or even that they want anything; insofar as I
          know, there is no sentience in anything the land-speakers interact with.

        is essentially hospitalitybased, and they can’t get too hostile towards armed
        newcomers as a group anyway, but the isles are not infinite in resources.
        Something has to give; if nothing else, perhaps the earlier arrivals start
        refusing new people entry.
      %p
        The pirates are also interesting, especially if you need a dedicated pirate
        mythology for your campaign. The idea that pirate crews consist of the refused
        minorities of Near’s various social disturbances goes a long way towards
        justifying the piracy, at least as far as sympathy goes. The consequences will
        sooner or later fall on the isles, though.
      %p
        I included the Governor as a sort of scenario-in-action, and to suggest that
        the pirate idyll on the isles is not a stable proposition that can just go on
        and on without the social dynamics going out of whack. Or perhaps it can – our
        own history knows of societies that successfully, continuously worked for
        hundreds of years on nothing but piracy and slave trade. Perhaps the original
        Kairakau humanism will get abased just like that.

    %p
      TSoY has a relatively involved equipment rules-set, which makes ships and boats
      and such mechanically quite simple. A ship is just a piece of equipment
      (chapter VI) for its captain, unless the player decides to forgo mechanizing
      the ship entirely. When a ship has multiple interesting characters, then the
      equipment is simply handled and used by multiple characters at once, each doing
      their part for the ship. Characters co-using equipment like this can share
      costs of using imbuements they use cooperatively, too.
    %p
      Sinking a ship most often happens as the outcome of a conflict; usually the
      ship’s captain has something to say about the matter, as will other characters
      in the crew. The ship itself does not have hit points or such; it’s all a
      matter of how far the captain is willing to go to protect his ship. Considering
      the consequences of a shipwreck, he will often protect his ship to the last, if
      not surrender.
    %p
      Crew is handled mostly as extras, nameless companions to the characters with
      personal interests. A singular crew member can stand out with his interests,
      even become a sidekick for the ship or leave the ship with little effect; an
      issue that affects the whole crew, on the other hand, is quick to escalate and
      take the ship from under its captain. The Story Guide will presumably lift some
      names from the crew to lead the mutiny if it comes to that; it’s a good idea
      anyway to have a couple of named secondary characters around so the player
      character involved with the ship has somebody to talk to. Another good idea is
      to keep the ship’s commission in mind: as a rule of thumb, as long as the
      captain has the KEY OF THE COMMISSION and he does not act against it, the crew
      will probably stay reasonably loyal; deviating from what the crew as a whole
      expects of the mission will require misleading or convincing the men to go
      along regardless.

        A traditional question in roleplaying concerns the role of specialty knowledge
        in playing the game: what do the players actually need to know about topics
        they play with? My own stance, especially regarding a game like TSoY, has long
        been that prior research is always a luxury, not a necessity; whatever it is
        that players know about a specialty topic like naval matters is sufficient for
        their own purposes. Knowing a lot about ancient galleys or age of sail naval
        tactics will certainly enrich the texture of the game, but it does not affect
        the dramatic component.

        Still, the naval setting is pretty interesting as an adventure environment, so
        a few choice examples of consideration might prove inspiring, especially if you
        have no idea what I mean when I refer to seafaring adventure. Consider:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Galleys
        %dd
          are independent from the wind, and can be very fast on tactical distances.
          They need daily resupplies from land (water especially), and are practically
          always beached at night. They can vary in size drastically from 50 men boats to
          150 men war galleys to crazy Ammenite floating fortresses with a thousand
          rowing men and half again as many marines. Overall they’re superior to the
          sailing ships Lords of Maldor or Princes of Ammeni can muster, at least near
          coasts and on the inland seas.
        %dt Ramming
        %dd
          is an efficient tactic for galleys to sink others or break their oars, and
          works for smaller ships against larger ones. It requires a ramming prow and
          skilled crew of rowers, however. Boarding action is easy in comparison, but
          that requires a taller ship than the enemy has, practically speaking.
        %dt Missile
        %dd
          weapons are entirely feasible for shipboard marines, although they require
          training and are not very effective on shielded enemy.
        %dt Slaves
        %dd
          can be used as rowers, but they’ll try to escape at night, and they suck at
          military-grade maneuvers. Quality navies, like that of Kalderon, use free men,
          or at least promise freedom to the slaves after the campaign.
        %dt Sails
        %dd
          are high tech in this context: they require expertise, proper cloth and
          innovation to get anything capable of going against the wind. Advantages are
          smaller crew (less need for supplies) and non-stop operation. A proper sail
          will outrun a galley every time at long distances and time frames, and it is
          capable of journeys a galley could never make.
        %dt Navigation
        %dd
          is difficult, as the stars have dimmed in most parts of Near. Going a week or
          two off the course is not unlikely as a rogue current or wind confuse the
          navigator.
        %dt Winter
        %dd
          is treacherous for seafarers, and only the Black Ships brave winter storms on
          the Southern Sea. The Sea of Teeth is usable all year long, but the tsunamis
          therein can sink even a Black Ship.
      .list.container
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Boating (I)
          %dd
            Smaller vessels that do not require a large crew are operated with this
            Ability. Such vessels are easier to procure and keep than larger ones; they
            also have benefits in stealth and coastal operations, being able to reach
            places larger ships couldn’t. Fishermen, smugglers and such would probably use
            this Ability for their hijinks.
          %dt Sailing (R)
          %dd
            Large ships that mostly rely on a properly trained crew are operated with this
            Ability, and perhaps suitable social Abilities used in commanding the crew. In
            comparison to boats, a ship can handle larger cargoes and longer journeys,
            making it appropriate for greater endeavors.
          %dt Navigation (R)
          %dd
            Most captains of Near navigate based on memorized coast profiles. This Ability
            can be used to tell where you are and where you should be going.
          %dt Command (I)
          %dd
            A larger ship will often have disciplinary issues, which are largely sorted by
            the captain using this Ability. The Ability is useful for gaining respect and
            getting obeyed; however, it rarely works on people who have not already decided
            to trust your lead.
          %dt Key of the Commission (specify)
          %dd
            The character is responsible to a crew hired for a certain mission. 1xp: Order
            the crew around. 2xp: Justify yourself to the crew. 5xp: Quell a mutiny.
            Buyoff: Abandon the mission.
          %dt Secret of the Captain
          %dd
            The character is a natural captain of a ship. He pays the introduction cost of
            his ship and other naval equipment only the first time it makes an appearance
            in the session.
          %dt Crew Imbuement
          %dd
            The crew of the ship can make Ability checks independently to support the
            character or do things for him. Their Ability level is equal to an applicable
            equipment rating (which cannot be further modified for this purpose by other
            Secrets), and they use the character’s own Pools. Cost: 1 Abilityappropriate
            Pool per check.
          %dt Hold Imbuement
          %dd
            The ship has extra hold for supplies, which translates into Pool: the ship has
            a Pool point that can be used as any Pool by the character. It is refreshed
            when the ship restocks in harbor.
          %dt Luxury Imbuement
          %dd
            The ship has luxurious accommodations for the officers and passengers. This
            might play into issues of refreshment and recovery, but mostly it’s just
            ostentatious.
          %dt Key of the Landlubber
          %dd
            The character is unaccustomed to sea life, and it shows. 1xp: Throw up. 2xp:
            Get ridiculed. 5xp: Fall into the ocean. Buyoff: Save a seaman’s life.
          %dt Key of the Scoundrel Crew
          %dd
            The character has shipped out with a bunch of no-good scoundrels. 1xp: The crew
            drinks or practices other vices. 2xp: Their vices cause trouble. 5xp: Get mixed
            up in their problems. Buyoff: Get out or accept the crew as they are.

    %p
      %em Fluff from Yesterday’s Heresies, crunch adapted from the same.
    %p
      The reign of Absolon did more for astronomy than any other science. As his
      royal astronomers divined the existence of eight stars that moved unlike any
      other, he tasked them to find the meaning of these. One was assigned to each
      star and they consulted with their findings until they came up with a radical
      idea.
    %p
      This idea: these were not stars at all. They were the servants of the Sun Lord,
      marching in his heavenly court, each tasked to oversee part of his kingdom.
      Even more radical, they believed that Near was a servant like these, spinning
      in an endless celestial dance. The royal geomancer was enlisted as one of these
      eight, and they formed a society dedicated to the heavenly reign of the Sun and
      the terrestrial reign of Absolon, one and the same. When Absolon took too much
      power and brought the foreign sorcerer Hanish to his side, the Nine struck with
      all their might to end his reign. They were hung for their treachery and fed to
      pigs.
    %p
      Three hundred years later, their knowledge lives on in the Secret Society of
      the Celestial Nine. The Nine are dedicated to the restoration of a Sun King
      over Maldor and will stop at nothing to achieve that. The leader of the Society
      of the Nine is always called NEAR. He fills the ancient spot of the royal
      geomancer, which was also the royal doctor, as the life of the Emperor was
      considered to be tied to the life of the world. His role is to chair the Nine
      in their Orbit, as they call the eternal plan of the world. Below him are the
      eight other Celestials. The name and roles of the Nine are as follows:
    %ul.simple
      %li
        ABRAMOV. Fire and judgment are the domains of Abramov. The person picked for
        this role is always an older person, an ember of life who looks destruction in
        the face daily.
      %li
        PHOLUS. The sky and waters are the domains of Pholus. The person picked for
        this role is always fluid and agile. Pholus may have been a woman at least once
        over the years.
      %li
        NEAR. Life is the domain of Near. The chair of the Nine, he is responsible for
        both human and animal life. The person picked for this role is always a man and
        always has knowledge of the land and of the body.
      %li
        KIEV. Battle and warfare are the domains of Kiev. A point of theological debate
        is whether Kiev made the Sky Fire to smite Near when it was found that Absolon
        was insane. The person picked for this role is always well trained in battle
        and has killed a man.
      %li
        MASAKO. Physical and social power are the domains of Masako. The person picked
        for this role is always immense in stature and a leader of men, often a lord of
        the land.
      %li
        GWANGJU. Magic is the domain of Gwangju. The person picked for this role is
        always knowledgeable in Three-Corner Magic, and sometimes knows other
        traditions.
      %li
        SIJJIN. Penance and absolution are the domains of Sijjin. The counselor of the
        Nine, the person picked for this role has always committed a crime against
        mankind.
      %li
        ENCHIRIDION. Mystery is the domain of Enchiridion. The person picked for this
        role never reveals his true identity to the Nine.
        FAR. Night and darkness are the domains of Far. The person picked for this role
        is always a foreigner.
    %p
      Each of these roles is filled by one person at a time. This person is taught
      secret lores and given potent weapons to fulfill his role. In the case that a
      member of the Nine passes, two of the Nine are tasked to find a replacement and
      initiate him. This person can come from any strata of society. This person is
      almost always a man, and almost always from Maldor.
    %p
      The Nine believe that the new Emperor, the new Sun King, has not been found. In
      each generation, there is one man fit to fill this role in their theology.
      Their goal is to seek him and guide him to rise to power. The cult has never
      succeeded in this goal, perhaps because they all have different ideas about who
      the true king is. They all believe the following things about the Sun King:
    %ul.simple
      %li The Sun King will be a man.
      %li The Sun King will be from Maldor.
      %li The Sun King will be strong in arm and fierce in battle.
      %li The Sun King will be strong in mind and wise in court.
      %li
        The Sun King's heart will be hard enough to make the decision to kill a
        thousand men.
      %li The Sun King's heart will be soft enough to make the decision to save one man.
      %li All Nine will agree on the true Sun King.
    %p
      Their secondary goal derives from the above: no man unworthy shall lead Maldor.
      The Nine have toppled rulers that have come close to uniting Maldor before and
      will do so again.
    %p
      The Nine Celestials usually have access to immense power. At least one of them
      at any time is very wealthy, and at least one of them is a highranking member
      of Maldorite society. In addition, their physical weapons and armor, crafted
      over the years, are very powerful. They are not sworn to secrecy in their role,
      but are assumed to exercise discretion. Revealing part of their secrets to one
      person is one thing; revealing the cult to a crowd is another.
    %p
      The sign of the Nine is a telescope. Each of them carries one. As the secret of
      optics is lost to all but perhaps some craftsmen of Inselburg, this is a rare
      and valuable gift and denotes that the person with one is one of the Nine or
      has taken it from one of them.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#knowledge-of-the-nine{:name => "knowledge-of-the-nine"} Knowledge of the Nine
      %p
        The Nine Celestials hold various rare, esoteric knowledges they use in their
        theology and practical work. Not all is known to each of them, for rarely they
        trust each other completely; rather, it may be assumed that each of the Nine
        has 1-3 pieces of nice crunchy crunch that is not common knowledge in the world
        (and especially Maldor) and that may or may not overlap with that of others.
      %p
        When a new member is initiated into the Nine, the two initiators share their
        secret knowledge with the new member they are sponsoring. This proves their
        trust in the new comrade and provides him with the means to do the work of the
        Nine.

        %a#artifacts-of-the-nine{:name => "artifacts-of-the-nine"} Artifacts of the Nine
      %p
        Each of the Nine have one or more powerful items that help them fill their
        roles. The origin of these items is mostly shrouded in mystery, but at least
        some are of recent origin, potentially replacing lost artifacts, while others
        are definitely from the antiquity, from several bounties of the Empire. All are
        of supreme quality and possess fabulous powers. The intent is that once the Sun
        King is crowned, the Artifacts will be relinquished into his regalia.
      %p
        When using the artifacts in play, determine their quality as equipment
        normally, adding or removing equipment ratings and imbuements as appropriate.
        An artifact may come into play already broken, too. The Story Guide should also
        remember that these are legendary artifacts; it’s no crime to reveal new powers
        lost to time. I would allow a player to check HISTORY (R) to renew the quality
        of an artifact, for example, potentially determining new powers.

          %dt Geomancy (R)

            This mostly lost art involves knowledge of the movements of earth power that
            influence Near in subtle ways. It is part of the secret knowledge held by the
            Nine and shared with some initiates, especially Near. The Ability is useful for
            finding sleeping giants, supporting engineering projects, messing with Qek
            knots and doing other slow, subtle magic.

        %a#id35{:name => "id35"} Ideas
      %p
        The Nine Celestials make a great slot-in solution for a campaign in Maldor in
        that they’re very simple to bring in: one or more of the group just need to get
        involved with a player character. This can happen when a character stumbles
        upon one of their artifacts they are trying to regain, or when they want to
        initiate a player character into the Nine, or simply when a familiar secondary
        character is revealed to be a member.
      %p
        A player character can also be a member of the Nine himself, no problem. The
        big issue for them in that case is genuineness: do they really believe in the
        Sun King theology, or are they just in it because the conspiracy can help them
        wield power themselves? If the latter, how do they react to co-conspirators who
        genuinely believe, not only in the Sun King, but in him? If the former, what
        about co-conspirators who obviously have other interests?
      %p
        Also, let’s say that Gwangju has witnessed a player character do something that
        makes him think that we have a Sun King here. Do you really think that the next
        thing to happen isn’t a series of murders, as either the prospective Sun King
        and his supporters, his opponents or ingenuine conspirators, or everybody for
        that matter, get killed? They have done it before, and they will do it again.

        %a#the-notion-of-scenario{:name => "the-notion-of-scenario"} The Notion of Scenario
      %p
        The important lesson to take away from the Nine (and the reason for why I
        included them, aside from my wanting to stress-test my new equipment rules) is
        how Story Guides prepare for playing TSoY. They do not prepare plots; they
        prepare material. The Nine Celestials are essentially an adventure module, it
        just replaces a plot with possibilities.
      %p
        A good SOLAR SYSTEM scenario gives some mechanical possibilities and suggests
        how to introduce them, but leaves the part the players play quite open: player
        characters might decide that the Celestial Nine are assholes, that they are the
        only hope for Maldor, or anything in between. This then becomes story, and the
        Story Guide need do nothing but keep introducing more members of the conspiracy
        (each and every one of them exceptional individuals, I’m sure; think of the
        LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN) while cackling at the players trying to
        figure out how to build a complete picture out of disparate individuals.

            the outside. It provides a bonus die when commanding others, and allows one to
            use the SECRET OF EVALUATE and the ThreeCorner ENHANCEMENT: BURST OF POWER. The
            final power is the ability to turn into a Twilight Beast, a ravening wolf-bear
            monster. The beast’s Reason is reduced to 1 level, with the excess split
            between the other Pools. The Twilight Beast’s best Ability is flipped with
            BESTIALITY (V) and the second-best with ENDURE (V), and he gains the SECRET OF
            NATURAL WEAPONS for his claws and form. Becoming the Twilight Beast costs 3

      %em Original work based on forum discussions with Josh.

      One thing that I like, but which has not been emphasized much in writing, is
      the idea of regionally important culture. It really is just a convenient
      simplification to say that “Sky God is only known in Goren” or “alchemy is not
      practiced outside Ammeni”; rather, it’s obvious that there are plenty of grey
      areas, and more of them as Near knits back together and the lives of all
      cultures are enriched by trade and other exchanges.
    %p
      Three-Corner magic works like this in my play, and for others: one can’t really
      say conclusively that Three-Corner is a “Maldorite phenomenon”, simply because
      it really is the universal magic, sort of like the magical Latin of Near’s dark
      ages. It might be most common in Maldor and originate there, but all societies
      of Near have to handle it to some degree.
    %p
      Gorenite witchcraft is similar, it’s been in the world for a long time and
      spread and gotten extinguished multiple times, if witches are to be believed.
      Its hold seems to be the strongest in patriarchal societies, which is seen in
      Maldor today, where the derived witchcraft of the Queen of Shadow is very much
      in play.
    %p
      All this means that it would hardly be fair to characterize witchcraft as a
      monolithic phenomenon. Rather, it’s more of a method that can be turned towards
      different purposes, as we can see now.

        The Vadenite islands have been colonized several times from the mainland. The
        latest wave happened when the Empire of Maldor brought in their navy and
        support staff in the early years of Absolon’s reign. The local culture of the
        time was prominently Gorenite, as the Jarls of both Gorens had been banishing
        people there for generations.
      %p
        Today the fortress of Inselburg is home to a hundred Collegiums of more or less
        shining repute. Some magisters are highly public figures, others desire privacy
        or even religious secrecy, while the rumored elven magister of the Skyfire Cult
        is only ever met at initiation ceremonies. However, there is one collegium that
        is not only secretive, but actually illegal on the free islands. The HORNED
        CONSORTIUM flouts the values and personal freedoms of the Vadenites to such a
        degree that it has long been forbidden. Still, the cult endures.
      %p
        The HORNED GOD is a figure of Gorenite myth, one of HER HUSBANDS, the male
        pantheon of the Gorenites. Among the old Vadenite population their worship
        never flagged, and some of it still remains. The Horned God is considered the
        greatest of the bunch by the CONSORTS, his worshippers, who form the illegal
        cult. They believe that the Horned God was not only the first of Her Husbands,
        but yet remains the only lawful one despite her many indiscretions.
      %p
        Members of the cult are quite secretive, but the Vadenite islands are isolated
        and insular, so there are some they rule handily. A few respected public
        personages of Inselburg are also members (including at least one Fleet
        officer), making for a strict separation between their public and private life.
        The cult is also popular among certain parts of the Ammeni princedom, although
        clearly illegal there as well for different reasons.
      %p
        The worst excesses of the cultists involve wholesale degradation of Vadenite
        women, whom they consider little better than beasts and less worthy of respect.
        It is not expected of the lower ranks of initiate, but the higher ones
        routinely capture, rape and murder women they find offensive, or sell them to
        Ammenite slavers. The mystical potency harnessed by these activities is used in
        magic that helps the initiates succeed in all of their endeavors.

            This is like the SECRET OF COVENANT RITES, except that the Horned God cannot

            share their Pools freely and sacrifice by the Covenant Rite rules in performing
            Three-Corner magic, and they can include Arcana into their workings as
            Three-Corner Secrets; sacrifices of blood from involuntary women are only worth
            one Pool point per woman, however, no matter the degree of sacrifice. The magic
            done within the ritual is limited by both the Three-Corner laws and the laws of
            High witchcraft, and any spells formed with Arcana only work for characters
            embodying the proper Aspect. The participants gain two extra bonus dice to be

            ritual, but it may get worse, depending on the check made. Hamond himself
            supplies any magic that involves the item performing its purpose; other magics
            might require other invocations. Cost: 1 VIGOR per magical rating, 1 REASON per

            been concertedly practiced in ancient Hamouad, the Land of Cynics. The Ability
            allows the character to rearrange divine mythology by introspection, by
            mastering symbolic logic and universal aesthetic laws; this is mostly useful
            for poetry, but combined with magic, it can be used to mess with existing
            magical systems to create new ones. Elaborate theologies such as the Gorenite
            pantheon and the Khalean Green World are especially vulnerable, while something

      %p
        The Consort Magister of the Horned Consortium wields numerous vows that are
        each formalized and taken very seriously by the cult. Furthermore, breaking
        some of the vows, causing certain disfigurations of the body as well as
        horrible nightmares, is necessary for the members to ascend to the highest
        ranks in the Consortium.
      %p
        Members bound by the Oath of Secrecy are taught the TRICKS OF CONSPIRACY, used
        by the cult in their work. They are expected to participate in the cult’s
        illegal activities. (Other typical tricks of the Horned God involve STRENGTH,
        WOMEN, ANIMALS, NIGHT and HUNT.)
      %p The Oath of Fealty is only required of members that profess religious interest in the worship of the Horned God. It provides the ARCANA OF HORN: RENEW, which is useless for a cultist without the KEY OF THE HORNED GOD.
      %p
        Finally, the Oath of Revenge is for desperate members who join the cult for
        passionate reasons. They are taught the SECRET OF VENGEFUL BLOW and the magical
        foci needed to use it, as well as other things they need to exact their
        revenge. The cult does not expect much of these initiates unless and until
        blackmailing them with their association provides some tangible reward.
      %p
        However, these are just the three lower orders of the cult. The real core of
        the cult commits to the “Thrice-Bound Oath” of the Horned God, gaining the
        SECRET OF RAISING THE HORN in return. The ThriceBound Oath may only be
        fulfilled by breaking at least one of the earlier Oaths, which all a character
        has to have sworn to get this far. Each Oath has a symbolical punishment:
        breaking the Oath of Secrecy causes nightmares that impart sacred knowledge,
        breaking the Oath of Fealty withers a finger off the character’s hand and
        breaking the Oath of Revenge causes terrible sores to his lower parts while he
        sleeps.
      %p
        The three lower orders are routinely granted by any Thrice-Bound cultist, while
        the Thrice-Bound Oath itself is only administered by the Consort Magister
        Thomas Conne himself. While the lesser vows are only associated with minimal
        crunch, all further witchery and Three-Corner spellcraft known to the cult
        associates with the Thrice-Bound Oath, providing a substantial discount in Pool
        costs. Breaking this last oath in part or full has drastic consequences; the
        Oaths held by Conne are LEGENDARY (5) and promise torture, death and a
        torturous afterlife.
      %p
        The Thrice-Bound circle of the cult convenes twice each year for a great hunt,
        preferably conducted on mainland in either Jošland or Maldor. The hunt is
        assisted by favored lower order associates and conducted for the purpose of
        RAISING THE HORN and any major Three-Corner spellcraft the cult needs done. The
        hunt concerns animals and women encountered, with targets released from cages
        if necessary.
      %p
        The Horned Consortium possesses a limited form of High witchcraft in the RITE
        MAGNIFICENT, as they do not benefit from the Covenant rites: invoking the
        Horned God does not allow ritual Workings or drawing forth Arcana. However, the
        Consorts have preserved knowledge of the GIFT OF HAMOND, eponymous for Her
        Husband the Craftsman. The ritual procedure itself is essentially similar to
        Gorenite witchcraft, the Consorts just need to invoke the Horned God instead of
        the Goddess. (If you’re wondering, like I did: the reason for why they don’t
        have to invoke Hamond to use his Secret is that their theology allows the
        Horned God to force the matter upon Hamond. Probably not many cult members who
        could uphold the Aspect of Hamond, anyway. Hamond’s Aspect Ability is probably
        CRAFTWORK (I), by the way.)
      %p
        If some of the Consortium crunch seems overly expensive to you without the
        magistery discounts, keep in mind that the Consortium is very young in its
        current form; it was the father of Thomas, Ezkil Conne, who transformed the
        collegium’s traditional practices, included Three-Corner knowledge garnered
        from refugee Maldorites and displaced the old men who used to control the much
        less disruptive old collegium. Only active theurgy made the current theology of
        the cult possible at all; presumably the practice would become more efficient
        with time, were the cult to become established and comfortable in their craft.

        Conne wants to use the Black Ships to actively impose order on the Southern
        Sea, curbing piracy and opening the doors to full development of the area; he

        The Horned Consortium is an example of the sort of stuff I’d expect in my own
        play; I haven’t playtested it – I’ve been playing with the new basic crunch in
        this book, haven’t had time. Still, when you get a game going with a group
        experienced in TSoY, turn the knobs south and let it rip.
      %p
        The elements typical of actual play (as opposed to general treatise) here are
        the highly specific crunch that might only be possessed by one person in the
        world at its extreme, the free mention of individual characters and the
        situation in action; like the last chapter, this one is also a SCENARIO waiting
        to happen.
      %p
        Also typical is the amount of synergy and influences that jump from one
        cultural sphere to another. It’s easy to forget when reading the neatly
        apportioned chapters of this book, but not only is Near on the brink of a new
        global era, but player characters and other exceptional, dramatic individuals
        are expected to do stuff like inventing a religion on a flimsy basis, combining
        two diametrically opposed magic systems into a cult empowered by a third one,
        and trying to jump start a maritime empire.

        It might be that only an Eclectic could successfully subvert and reveal the

        Even if the Consortium is evil (I sort of hope that you agree with me that it
        is, although the game works swimmingly either way), Thomas Conne might be just
        intellectually lazy and/or fanatical. What if his goals are a good idea?

        An original motivation for including this chapter was that I didn’t have room
        for the witchcraft magic item creation rules in chapter 18. Do reintegrate if

      I got this one almost verbatim from Nick, who released it to the wilds a couple
      of weeks ago. I figured that I might as well put it in the book, considering
      how I was on the roll, liked the material and got permission. I think this is a

      %p
        A valley lies between Maldor and Ammeni, yet no caravans go there and no lord
        desires it. It is a cursed place, punished to this day for the callous
        atrocities committed during the Year of Night by Esau Neverfull, Count of
        Casnic. The valley's curse is simple, direct, and blunt: Beast shall not serve
        man.
      %p
        As the story has it, Esau, a Companion of Absolon, looked to save his county
        from the Shadow Night by wizardry. Sapa the Assartist created for him SIJJIN'S
        FARRO: a grain that needed no light nor warmth to grow, but required blood and
        carrion in addition to water and soil. The peasantry initially accepted this
        was necessary for survival, but their support waned when animals – livestock,
        pets, and working animals of all forms – began to fall ill and die. The
        uprising began in earnest, however, when word spread that the Count's men
        attempted to nourish the farro with human sacrifice.

        %p
          The peasantry survived until the sun rose again, but they discovered the
          further costs of Sijjin's farro. Sapa created a grain that sent animals wild
          with its bloom, when the hazy grey pollen of the grain was sent into the air. A
          little of the pollen makes tame animals wild and wild ones hostile; a lot sends
          them all careening into an irrecoverable madness.
        %p
          Centuries after the world began anew, this curse of the farro is still in
          effect. Farmers in Sireap no longer plant Sijjin's farro, but it grows as a
          weed around all graveyards and cemeteries, marking the area with its black-red
          chaff and stalks.

        The Sirepani live in a primarily agricultural society with a decentralized
        political structure based around village life. They have a rich diet almost
        completely devoid of meat. Some choose to abstain from necessity, others due to
        conviction.
      %p
        Over the past few centuries the Sirepani have compensated for their lack of
        animals by training themselves to the point of making mounts irrelevant. The
        Sirepani are famous for both their prowess at running and their ability to
        carry loads over long distances. At least one Ammeni noble is quite proud of
        his Sirepani porters.

        The villages are each ruled by a VECHIL, who originally was the count’s
        overseer but now rules as a hereditary servant of the people. The customs are
        strict on how much the Vechil can own, and how new Vechils may not live in the
        home villages of their parents.

          Villages send men and women to work for the Vechil as part of their taxes. They
          are called the USHERS, and generally serve terms of 2–4 years, depending on
          what arrangements the Vechil has in that particular village. They are the
          official representatives of the Vechil's authority, and keep the peace, bring

          The ushers wear light brigantine armor, and their traditional weapons are the

          more curved blade than normal. In combat, the Ushers are extremely competent
          skirmishers, known for their incredible maneuverability and closing speed. More

        This is the sort of simple, straightforward material that characterizes solid
        TSoY scenario preparation: some history, some crunch, social principles upon

        and go.
      %p
        In the heart of the Valley lies Casnic, now an abandoned nest of ratkin. The
        beasts are addicted to the farro, which they eat or burn in water pipes
        scavenged from the ruins.
      %p
        An elf lives in Casnic, one going by the name of Slusch Bash. She wields

        It is possible to bring animals to Sireap, it’s just that the farro is so

      a couple of years ago for TSoY on the forums. Frank was asking for ideas for
      his campaign, and I got carried away.

      I don’t usually play such adventurous scenarios in TSoY, but I like the sword &amp;

      sympathy. Hopefully this’ll be useful for those readers who want an in-depth
      example of how Story Guides prepare material for TSoY.

      %p
        This whole scenario is written with a completely character-based paradigm: I
        the Story Guide look at the Keys and other important facets that characters
        have, and then produce content that resonates with those elements. This is a
        particular method for creating adventures, and not the only possibility; it’s a
        good one, however, and educative to present here.
      %p
        When working with this sort of Story Guiding philosophy, there’s an useful
        word: a FLAG is any clearly signaled plan or wish a player has for the game,
        especially one that is written down and presented clearly to the Story Guide.
        The Keys are, of course, all flags, and other crunch might be as well.
      %p
        As it says on the box, this sort of adventure is tailored to the specific
        characters to some degree. It’ll be hit and miss whether it’ll suit a different
        set of protagonists. They often do (people aren’t that different), but it’s not
        guaranteed.

        %a#the-band{:name => "the-band"} The Band
      %p
        Here are the flags that I had to work with when developing the content. As can
        be seen, I don’t actually care how many characters there are or which
        characters go with which flags; the idea is not to tailor the content to the
        characters, but just to make sure there exists content that is pertinent to
        them. The players take care of orienteering their characters towards content
        that interests them.
      %p
        One of the characters was an elf, one was goblin. One had an intelligent
        blood-drinking sword. Two had the Key of Glittering Gold, and then there were
        the Keys of Magician, Impostor, Masochist, Community, Renown and Bloodlust.
      %p
        Looking at the list, the sword and bloodlust are the same thing for our
        purposes; I’ve removed the Key of the Masochist from this book, I didn’t
        understand then and don’t understand now what was interesting about it; the
        other flags all factored into my scenario design.
      %p
        It’s notable that the player characters are explicitly a group of adventurers
        out looking for the ancient Zaru capital. This goes a long way in explaining
        why their motivations are relatively superficial; it’s not a problem, the Story
        Guide just needs to prepare for simple and cinematic scenes, not for
        understated drama.
      %p
        Note that relying on flags is ultimately about trusting the players to actually
        know what they are interested in. This is not a given; less experienced players
        will actually choose Keys they will not enjoy or care of due to all sorts of
        confusion. So don’t stare blindly at what the players have written down, even
        if by rights they shouldn’t have written things they don’t mean.

      %p
        The ancient Zaru capital was the First City, built when farming was invented
        long ago in the Zaru heartland. The language of Zu had started spreading
        outside the Zaru lands, and as it spread, it weakened; the people could no
        longer be supported in the city, and thus they followed their language and
        spread over the land, farming it. The First City itself, once heavily
        populated, was left to decline.
      %p
        I imagine the citizens of that time as lithe, tall people with big oval heads
        and loose robes. That’s what the peoples of lost civilizations look like in
        CONAN comics.
      %p
        The slow, leisurely decline of the Zaru city was interrupted by a Maldorian
        CULTURAL INSPECTION unit. These were hero bands sent by the Three-Corner
        Academy into the wide world to do adventure anthropology during the latter half
        of Absolon’s reign: go into communities of the various subject peoples,
        interview them and live with them, spy or trade or intimidate their secrets out
        of them and report back to the Academy to enrich the academic knowledge base.
        The Three-Corner magic was created out of this basic work.
      %p
        The mission of this particular CI unit was to pillage the First City for any
        secrets of Zu yet to be released to the public, and bring back enough experts
        to help fill out the still lacking understanding of Zu in the academic circles.
        According to reports that came back, the CI unit was welcomed in the city with
        open arms. However, something went wrong, and the CI unit never came back.

        The City itself is just your run of the mill ruined fantasy city; the Story
        Guide can improvise the narrative details of something like that easily enough.
        What makes the scenario are its specific elements:
      %p
        The Community and Goblin flags are pinged by a goblin tribe living in the city.
        They’re really primitive, and pathetically grateful to any civilized being who
        treats them with kindness. However, they want any benefactors to join their
        Tribe of the Crystal by swallowing a sharp, fist-sized crystal chunk broken off
        a mysterious building. They’re quite insistent. The thing is, a non-goblin
        would surely die from swallowing the sharp stone. Goblin anatomy on the other
        hand adapts, ousting the crystal halfway, leaving it stuck on the goblin’s
        tummy as a tribal symbol. Being that humans usually die when they try to join
        the tribe, the goblins tend to be skeptical about them.
      %p
        The Glittering Gold flag is pinged by the crystal itself: pieces are really
        valuable, but they're also sacred to the goblins, and dangerous to get (a giant
        lizard lives in the building with the crystal, for example), and you have to be
        a master artisan to polish them, unless you harvest directly from live goblins,
        whose stomach juices polish the crystal into an ethereal shine.
      %p
        The Magician and Elf flags are pinged by the elf Nether, who was trapped under
        the City in the calamity that ruined the place. Nether was a member of the CI
        unit and has been stuck under the city ever since; either he’s afraid to die,
        or he gets reincarnated in the same place due to a Zaru curse, or he’s just too
        stubborn and committed to die and leave FORMULAE TRIANGULI ZUONIS CONDITA, the
        incomplete book of integrating Zu into Three-Corner magic. Whichever the case,
        Nether would promise almost anything to anybody who freed him. Nether is a
        MAGUS of the Academy, meaning that he’s mastered multiple arts; one of those is
        spirit shamanism, which he uses to walk in the city in spirit and seek help,
        desperate for human contact.
      %p
        The Bloodlust flags get pinged by the aforementioned large lizard. It was a pet
        of a CI unit member who died here, and it’s been living and growing here ever
        since, solitary and forlorn.  It’s huge and nasty and quite able to follow
        adventurers out of the city, should it be necessary; it still remembers Nether
        and while not humanintelligent, it is faithful and patient.

        More Glittering Gold is found in the city as ancient Zaru coinage; the gold was
        used to buy off barbarians and trade. The trick with the gold is that it’s
        being guarded by a number of ghostly sasha, ancient Zaru elders (those forehead
        guys in flowing robes). They’ve trapped the elf under the city ruins, which
        keeps their sashas intact through the ages, waiting for a worthy hero who’d
        take the gold and use it for Zaru liberation.
      %p
        The Impostor flag is amply serviced by the elements above: the goblins would be
        happy to be misled, the elf is desperate for sweet promises and the ancient
        Zaru ghosts are as gullible as only three centuries old pacifists in bathrobes
        can be.
      %p
        Finally, Renown comes into play in the form of an outsider: a cocky Khalean or
        wily Ammenite adventurer has followed the player characters into the city. He’s
        eager to help, faithful in action, and a total glory-hound after the fact,
        willing to lie about his actions. If he’s allowed to stick around, he’s going
        to steal the glory from the character who’d be gaining the sweet xp otherwise.
      %p
        As can be seen, this stuff is totally purposeful; I don’t dwell on fictional
        detail or poetics at this stage, I just pull out concepts that have significant
        interaction with what and who the player characters are. The same method would
        work no matter what the flags, as long as the premise of the game is to have
        player characters arrive and explore a new environment, learning as they go.
      %p
        Note that even while this is a Zaru city, I do no more than hint at the Zaru
        signature magic, Zu. The goblins, the elf and the ghosts all hold Zu, add it
        liberally.
      %p
        Also note that I’m listing these advance preparations as KEY ELEMENTS in the
        crunch. I rarely use Key Elements myself in play, but that’s just because I
        don’t often do these preparations on paper; if I had more than some scattered
        thoughts in my head, I might well use Key Elements as well.

        %a#situations{:name => "situations"} Situations
      %p
        I don’t always prepare more than one or two compelling SITUATIONS (called BANGS
        in many games) explicitly, but it’s a good practice if you find yourself
        searching for content to proceed with in the middle of a game.
      %p
        For this material, there are many obvious interactions that can be brought to
        the fore whenever the action is lagging and the Story Guide needs to propose
        something. Like so:
      %ul.simple
        %li Meeting the goblins.
        %li The goblins use their crystal Zu.
        %li The goblins offer a character tribe membership and initiation.
        %li
          A support character suggests that the goblins could be gutted for a rich
          harvest in crystals.
        %li
          A support character suggests that the lizard could be distracted to loot
          crystals from their origin.
        %li The elf appears to somebody, asking for help.
        %li
          The elf is a wreck after spending 300 years in captivity; needs major emotional
          support.
        %li The giant lizard approaches an amiable character, seeking friendship.
        %li The gold is found.
        %li The Zaru ghosts are encountered.
        %li
          The ghosts show the gold to a character and ask him to dispose of it
          honorably in aid of Zaru people.
        %li
          The ghosts ask things of the world, making it obvious that they really are very
          gullible.
        %li The glory-hound adventurer is spotted and encountered.
        %li
          The glory-hound shows his colors by trying to steal credit, or take it
          rightfully.
        %li The lizard follows the group and seeks revenge.
      %p
        Note that the situations are not in any order and do not represent a plot plan;
        they are just obvious imperatives, based on what the different characters in
        the scenario want.
      %p
        Situations are useful to list in that they might help to remind you in the
        middle of the game about the different issues in the story. You can cross them
        over as you introduce them into the game, and when everything’s been both
        introduced and dealt with, the adventure is over. This is a very general model
        of Story Guiding work: prepare material, throw out material for the players to
        deal with, close the books and send everybody home after getting through your
        material. Simple.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#writing-your-own{:name => "writing-your-own"} Writing Your Own
      %p
        As you can see, it’s easy to write this sort of scenario; Story Guiding it in
        practice is slightly more difficult, mainly because the players can make it
        easier or more difficult for you. To ease your work, keep the AUTHORSHIP VEIL
        that develops for the Story Guide as low as possible: make sure the players are
        continuously aware not only of their vast rights under the SOLAR SYSTEM, but
        also of their responsibility towards you as a co-player. Do not walk into the
        trap of pretending immunity; show it when the other players confuse you or play
        in ways you don’t appreciate.
      %p
        Still, assuming that the group communicates well and the Story Guide has
        actually understood what he’s supposed to do with the prepared elements, this
        method can be a powerful tool for you. To repeat, here are the technical steps
        in a nutshell:
      %ol.arabic.simple
        %li
          Look at the characters and recognize their flags. List them out. Don’t
          forget to be critical and remove false flags, and add things you know the
          players will like but which they didn’t write out.
        %li
          Choose your fictional milieu and populate it with secondary characters that
          “ping” or resonate with those flags you listed. They should resonate because
          their own, understandable interests are somehow relevant to the flags, not
          because you’ve preplanned actions they’ll take or the player characters take.
        %li
          Refine a list of situations from your list of people and places: remember
          that situations should be both interesting and open, as per the SOLAR SYSTEM.
        %li Create new crunch to taste.
        %li
          When playing, feed appropriate situations to the players, see how they
          react, play the consequences objectively and hard. Let the story emerge.
        %li
          Once you have all of your scenario elements on the table and well
          introduced, start driving towards conclusion of any storylines that have not
          resolved yet. Once they do, you’ve finished the story. In my experience this
          method works nearly always. To put it simply, this’ll fail only if the players
          do not engage with your prepared material for some reason.
  .section
    %h2
      %a#going-out-advice-and-hints{:name => "going-out-advice-and-hints"} Going Out: Advice and Hints
    %p
      %em Draws on many forum discussions and almost all publications.
    %p
      I’ll quote Clinton here, because he said it best: “I really want you and your
      group to take this world and run with it. Whatever you decide is up is great.”
    %p
      That’s pretty much what we’ve done through the last couple of years, developing
      the ideas you’ve seen in this book. Using the entire Near in one grand,
      holistic campaign was difficult and pointless before; now it’s all but
      impossible, as the game has fractured into many different directions as
      inspiration has taken it. This plurality engendered by free communication and
      the Internet is a new thing insofar as roleplaying game settings go; we have
      something that is at the same time flexible, concrete and shared.
    %p
      While putting this book together I’ve been thinking about this same thing from
      a different angle, thinking about what roleplayers expect roleplaying game
      settings to be. My ultimate conclusion is that while we think of a setting as a
      pre-existing world we utilize in different manners, this can never really be in
      actual, real play at the table. When we play, the books are always there as
      reference material only, as something to read from when, moment-to-moment, it
      is more rewarding or useful to look for answers in the book.
    %p
      Still, looking at my own play, the book has never been our primary source when
      we’ve played THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY. That source was always the PLAY ITSELF.
      This might be difficult to understand, but when you play and the game really
      breathes for you, it is obvious: you are the one who sees the setting, and you
      know how things need to be to fulfill the needs of this campaign, this session
      right here. The book can only ever be a starting point for this process. There
      might be different methods for using settings in adventure roleplaying games
      like SOLAR SYSTEM, but I’ve yet to master them; this style I know, and I know
      that the best kind of setting book for it is one that only provides the
      interesting inspiration, leaving the details for us to see with our own eyes in
      play.
    %p
      To round off this overview of Near, here are some notes about what lies beyond.
      Insofar as I know, nobody has played with these ideas; many of them have hardly
      been discussed. For those who enjoy breaking completely new ground in their
      play and Story Guiding, there is much yet to discover. Whatever I could write
      could not be as authoritative as the facts you reveal by actually going there
      and seeing for yourself.
    .list.container
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Exploration (I)
        %dd
          While most peoples of Near are still wrapped in their own problems, some choice
          individuals look beyond the hills and see those that come from the clash of
          whole cultures. Many are from Ammeni, which is sort of grim. Still, this
          Ability can be taken by anybody with the heart of an adventurer. It can be used
          to know stories about faraway places, write concise accounts of the same and,
          in the highest scale, conduct successful expeditions.
        %dt Secret of the Unknown
        %dd
          The character can use EXPLORATION (I) or STORYTELLING (R) to establish KEY
          ELEMENTS (as per the SOLAR SYSTEM) with total experience value equal to the
          check result. These are always things about which the character knows nothing
          certain, such as the lost valley of Sireap or the Gharialin Templar. Cost: 1
          REASON per check.
        %dt Key of Exploration
        %dd
          The character yearns for the unknown. 1xp: Hear of an unknown place. 2xp:
          Discover things you’ve never seen before. 5xp: Discover something that isn’t in
          this book. Buyoff: Settle down.

      %p
        Is “Near” the planet or the continent? Sources disagree. Regardless, I like the
        notion that outside Near the design precepts start to tear up in ways
        challenging for the group that chooses to explore them: “no gods, no monsters,
        just people” and other basic themes may give way in unexpected manner beyond
        where Hanish could see.
      %p
        I am always careful of the tone in Near, but beyond those borders (wherever
        they are, geographically speaking) all bets are off. In fact, I might consider
        this as the real definition of Near.

          I know only one thing for sure about what lies beyond the mountains: if you
          thought that Near was broken by the Skyfire incident, life is probably about a
          thousand times worse on the side not protected from the impact.
        %p
          I imagine coasts mired into a muddy morass by giant waves for hundreds of miles
          inland. I imagine plains of glass caused by celestial heat. I imagine sandy
          deserts scoured of all life.

          Absolon, but who knows.
        %p
          When the Hamouadi ruled in the past and the Wound of Heaven was yet to be,
          their influence was mighty; only the jungles of Qek separated them from the
          Empire of Maldor in the age of the empires. The city of Kalderon was built to
          curb their influence in the Oranide plains, which at that time extended far to
          the north and around the Roof of the World.

          remain beyond the Wound of Heaven.
        %p
          My sources indicate that the people of Shar-Tek have a permanent geomantic knot
          on their mountain home, in which they hold alien technology or magic from the

        to gaming in Near, I know what the name of my next campaign is going to be:
      %p FAR: A PLANETARY ROMANCE
      %p
        Actually, that might be the name of a book, although I’ve told everybody to not
        encourage me about that. Anyway, as the careful reader has noticed, Near has
        certain celestial connections. I’m seeing the potential for some unholy cross
        of BARSOOM, NINE WORLDS and SPELLJAMMER here.

      An acquaintance spent last spring playing TSoY. I think that he might have
      overheated, for afterwards he could recount me the whole length of the history
      of Near, beginning several years before the Skyfire and ending with the
      Glorious Reascent of Yelm – that is, Absolon – no, Absolonda, I mean.
    %p
      A certain irreverence and willingness to take on a narrative challenge even at
      the risk of failure is something we share in our tastes, so I can appreciate
      how he laughingly steals inspiration and makes it his own, using the wildest
      sources and refusing to follow conventions blindly. It’s a sort of narrative
      maturity, a refusal to hide behind the veil of authorship: we all know the
      pieces that stories are made of, so there’s no point in pretending to
      originality or a suspension of disbelief when you just want to tell and
      experience stories. Everybody at the table saw what you just did, but you don’t
      care, because you’re all in on the joke. I’ve found that in roleplaying I can
      at the same time be totally cynical and superficial in my sources, but also
      committed to taking the resulting story seriously; this is a lot like the way
      an author feels. There is no man behind the curtain, there is just us.
    %p
      I was told that there was no Absolon, to begin with. She was called Absolonda,
      the grandmother. Ridiculous, of course, but there was proof: she had left a set
      of diaries (in true Jane Austen style) for safekeeping with a clan of dwarves
      concerned with history.
    %p
      Furthermore, there was a boon that would change the shape of the world: a
      doorway to another world. As she would have it, one day a band of heroes would
      arrive through the doorway, make a mess of things and then set everything
      right. Now it stands abandoned somewhere in Sireap Valley, long forgotten by
      everybody.
    %p
      Then there was also serious trouble in Qek: bodies of long-dead behemoths,
      brought up from tar pits by abusive spirit-talkers, were being fought to a
      standstill by the largest of apes: because of ancient jungle law there is
      always a larger ape, and thus the latter could ultimately crush the former, but
      not before causing great destruction. At this point the story got somewhat
      crazy, but I was assured that it was not only completely serious, but also
      going somewhere.
    %p
      You see, it did not matter that setting canon and expected style was being
      broken, as long as the characters in the story believed in their roles, the
      Story Guide believed in the consequences of any actions taken, and the players
      believed in the story more than mere setting facts. Whatever the story would be
      in genre and message, that would be revealed after the fact, not before.
    %p
      People have been dying in Maldor a lot. Forcing a Qek necromancer to travel
      there to do a resurrection job was not the smartest of moves. Now the dead are
      rising en masse, and nobody knows what to do.
    %p
      The only real man’s way of having a sword duel is with light sabers, as
      everybody knows. You can make one out of semi-common ingredients, such as
      Three-Corner wizards properly motivated, or by proving your talents to a
      Highland Saint.
    %p
      Trollbabes are something that’s been very current for me lately. These lovely
      lasses are all goblin and all woman. Meeting one is fun, because she’s not
      actually a part of this story, but she’s going to meddle in it anyway, just
      like a player character.
    %p
      I was, of course, not believing a word of it. Especially not when Agarim got
      involved, and he was just a big wolf.
    %p
      I think that part of it is a relaxed knowledge that you can write yourself up
      the tree and down the tree and around the tree if you want; there’s no hard
      need to get everything right and perfect anymore like there was when we were
      teenagers emulating Lord of the Rings; we’ve done the genre fantasy thing
      already, now we can just enjoy the elements and mix them anew.
    %p
      Everybody who knew Absolonda had been long dead, of course. Fortunately, there
      is the so-called “Schrödinger Gambit”: travel back in time via the Green World,
      meet with Absolonda and then return, which would retroactively bring back her
      sasha, the spirit of memory. Don’t try it at home without proper guidance.
    %p
      Elves make for mean assassins when they want to. There’s no point, though: no
      matter how many Prefects she suicide-bombs by surprise, they just elect more of
      them. It’s an eternal war, and thinking up a new way of sneaking into the
      fortress sort of gets old after a while.
    %p
      Three-Corner wizardry is considered weak, but that’s just because the third
      trinity is not known on Near. The space goblins don’t have it much better,
      frankly, as they lack the Day trinity in turn. But combine those knowledges and
      you’re on the verge of discovering the Tenth Focus.
    %p
      Opening a door to another world is easy when you know how. Aside from Soft
      Places, you can always use Wondersmithing, if you can get the dwarves to do it.
      There is no point, though: the heroes were us all along.
    %p
      Thus, great adventures were had, and verily Story Guides took every possible
      opportunity to draw in multitudes of intertextual references and pop-culture
      shoutouts. The wildest of ideas, once brought afoot, were grabbed completely
      seriously and compelled to do the work of a thousand men.
    %p
      And despite all this, still characters were made to do as their hearts bid
      them, and still great feats were attempted and recorded in sincerity, themes
      were realized and art was created, which made it all worthwhile.
