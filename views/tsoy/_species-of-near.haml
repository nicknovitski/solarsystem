  %p
    This movement reveals the Human Equation, the secret operating system of Near.
    The people, no matter what they seem like or think like, are all similar under
    the surface. The theme is prejudice, of course.
  %p
    The Old Species have lived together forever, and have learned to get by
    somehow. Each has found their own role in the world.
  %p
    Then there are the Beastkin, who are different. In what way, nobody knows yet.
    Too early to tell, they’ve been with us for mere generations.
  %p
    The species are an opportunity for the players to consider: what would life be
    like if you were immortal, or could reinvent yourself every day? What would you
    think of another, who were so drastically different?

      Near is home to many different peoples, of which humans are just one, albeit a
      common baseline. Other Old Species, such as elves, goblins, dwarves and giants,
      have always been with humanity in one way or another.
    %p
      What is not common knowledge is that all of these Old Species are in some
      fundamental manner human. Their differences, while considerable, are all to
      some degree surmountable.

      %p
        Humans are the default species of the game, they don’t have any special rules
        attached to them aside from some optional crunch on the facing page. Other
        species, however, do: each has a mandatory Secret they need to take to belong
        to that species. (It costs an Advance, too.) In addition, each species has
        various other specific crunch the player may sample at their pleasure.
      %p
        The Old Species have a special place, as they are all long ubiquitous in all
        parts of Near. Thus all civilizations have had to form some sort of stance on
        them. Even the rare elves and giants are known as something other than pure
        fantasy to all but the most ignorant.
      %p
        The Beastkin, meanwhile, tend to be local to certain parts of Near. Partially
        this is because they’ve been in the world for such a short time, partially
        because their instincts are adapted best to their home terrain.

        %p
          As with everything else, the species are very much optional content that should
          be introduced deliberately; each of the Old Species can have some sort of role
          in every land of Near, but it’s up to you to decide what.
        %p
          In this case I’m not even close to joking. This material can have a huge impact
          on the nature of the game; if you haven’t already, throw out that need to have
          an unitary canon reality where all setting material is under consideration all
          the time. For instance, consider this: the original TSoY book by Clinton
          featured a tri-partite, “classical” Human Equation where all creatures of Near
          were interpreted as either elves, humans or goblins. This is a beautiful and
          uncomplicated model, and I do not for a moment consider refuting it by merely
          including other species. Rather, consider the expanded Human Equation as an
          alternative model that intentionally breaks the metaphysics: the group has to
          actively work to figure out how these beings, and these only, fit into the
          Equation.

          As a general rule of thumb, the species crunch of each species addresses how
          each Old Species can become human. This seems to happen through Key buyoff,
          incidentally. How humans become those creatures, if they do – that is for play
          to find out.

      %p
        It is practical to make humans the baseline of “people” in Near, as that’s what
        we are. Humans of Near come in all colors, shapes and sizes we know from Earth.
        Most distinct ethnicities seem like one or other people from the coasts of the
        Indian Ocean, but everybody seems to be in there somewhere, such as the
        Caucasian nobility of Maldor, for example.
      %p
        What makes humans distinct from other peoples of Near is their passion –
        humanity, simply put. Humans commit to values, beliefs and ideologies, make
        them part of their own identity. They find differences and similarities with
        each other and stranger beings. No other being is as responsive to religion or
        as prone to fear as humans are. Each and every one of them thinks on some level
        that he is special.
      %p
        I wouldn’t worry too much about the fact that non-humans are to a degree
        archetypal and one-dimensional as individuals when compared to the immense
        individuality of humanity. That is what they are there for: if you didn’t want
        your character to have the weight of a whole racial destiny as part of his
        identity politics, then a non-human was a weird character choice to begin with.
      %p
        The one thing humans have that distinguishes them from others is the ultimate
        passion, Love. In fact, it is such an important part of their being that the
        Human Equation runs mostly on it. Other Old Species do not know Love – whether
        anybody but humans does is an open question.

    %p
      %em Fluff from Clinton’s book. Crunch adapted from the book and forum discussions.
    %p
      Elves are human-like creatures, yet more perfect and independent in every way.
      They do not spawn children nor do they grow old or die of violence or illness;
      they are self-sufficient and aloof creatures that are despised, feared or
      revered.
    %p
      For the most part elves seem human, except that their bodies are too perfect to
      be real; an elf creates its own body by the force of their will. They all have
      a fair seeming, with skin color ranging from light olive to pale alabaster,
      hair white, golden or reddish sand. An inner light enlightens them so: all
      elves are unmistakable in that they have an AURA, a soft nimbus of light that
      surrounds them. It might be missed at mid-day, but at night an elf is obvious
      to the eye.
    %p
      Elves tend to be solitary creatures without roots. This is not to say that they
      are not social; they can be incredibly magnetic. They do not, however, usually
      settle down in one place and form lasting relationships. It is said that one
      cannot trust an elf for “whatever good he does, he does for his own purposes”.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#immortality{:name => "immortality"} Immortality
      %p
        Elves are people who have looked deep within and found only one thing there:
        the self. Dedicated like a Zen master, they have realized the world is illusory
        and the only truth is what one thinks of one's self. Upon the death of the
        body, these souls do not pass on, but return again and again, as a more perfect
        form.
      %p
        This sort of worldview kind of shuts the door on most religion. The elf
        recognizes no god or greater power, only more powerful souls. Strangely, this
        sort of self-absorption doesn't always lead to evil: many elves roam the world
        doing good to either appease something inside them or perhaps for amusement.
        Others strike down anything in their path, realizing the insignificance of
        others that have not achieved their enlightenment. Whatever the attitude, an
        elf lives on, seeking to know itself deeper.
      %p
        Sometimes, an elf strays from this path. They were once human, after all,
        although it's not too wise to mention that. Any time an elf recognizes another
        life as greater than his own, he falls from Elfhood. If an elf either saves the
        life of another, dying or becoming mortally wounded in the process, or has
        children, they become somewhat human.  (If the elf died for another, he is
        reborn a last time.) Their aura dims and becomes grey, and they begin to get
        older like a human: they have entered the Grey Age. Other elves usually despise
        a Grey One for his weakness.
      %p
        Mechanically, an elf turns grey by buying off the KEY OF THE SELF. A grey elf
        loses his aura and all crunch related to it (losing the Advances, note), but
        retains his memory of the past. He can also gain human crunch afterwards.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#elven-magic{:name => "elven-magic"} Elven Magic
      %p
        The most powerful magic of the elf is the fact that it's immortal. Elves come
        into this world at maturity, and do not age unless they want to. Most do, over
        their many incarnations, as their self-image becomes more wizened. They do not
        catch diseases, although they can be poisoned. Their body is only a shell they
        have created, and even if struck down, they return to the world of Near.
      %p
        An elf, if feeling introspective – and when aren't they? – may speak of Heaven.
        This may be the only religious belief elves have: that when they achieve
        perfect enlightenment, they will leave Near and enter perfect oneness, when the
        illusion of Near disappears for them, and they see it for what it is, their own
        dream. This Heaven is as horrific of an idea to a human as it sounds – the elf
        sees himself as the dreamer of everything and everyone else, and he will take
        his true place in Heaven.
      %p
        Elven magic manifests itself in other minor forms, however. Elven AURAS are
        very powerful Secrets and have many special abilities that protect the elf and
        project its will on others. The long age of an elf seems like magic to other
        peoples, as well: elves can draw on their many experiences to perform nearly
        any feat.

          %a#aura-smithing{:name => "aura-smithing"} Aura Smithing
        %p
          Elves do not usually practice craft skills, as their aura tends to have a
          strange effect on any equipment they carry on their person or handle regularly.
          Such items take on a part of the Elven aura, slowly becoming more perfect and
          ethereal versions of them. This can happen at Story Guide discretion
          spontaneously, but to control it in any way, the elf needs the SECRET OF AURA
          IMBUEMENT.
        %p
          When imbuing an item, an aura smith does not make a distinction between mundane
          and magical effects; an Elven item may well have extraordinary abilities. The
          elf can only set ratings for things he has experienced and imbue Secrets he
          himself has known, however, aside from IMBUEMENTS that are only available for
          items. Specifically, all aurasmithed items have the ELVEN IMBUEMENT.
        %p
          Elven items all have an aura recognizably similar to that of the item’s
          creator. Should the creator ever lose his aura, the item will turn into a grey,
          mundane version of itself. An item with multiple ELVEN IMBUEMENTS has an even
          stronger aura and might even develop rudimentary sentience.
        %p
          Because aura smithing does not require Ability checks, the patient elf can
          easily make his item ever more perfect. However, TRANSCENDENT (7) quality Elven
          items transcend at the end of the scene in which they are raised to this level,
          appropriately enough, disappearing from the world.

      %p
        When the Sky Fire fell to Near, all elves disappeared. Not a single one was
        seen for over two hundred years. As to where they went, no one knows, not even
        the elves. Elves' stories are varied: most purport that they were always here
        and have no memory of leaving or those two hundred years, while others speak of
        Far, another world they are able to visit.
      %p
        Whatever happened, elves are loathe to speak of it. Since they have returned,
        though, it is obvious the Shadow Moon has had an effect on them. Once elves
        were friendly towards each other, greeting other ones on the path to
        enlightenment. Once, when an elf was asked about the logical fallacy in two
        elves both thinking the universe is their dream, he said, “It is not known
        whether I am dreaming him dreaming the world, or he is dreaming me dreaming the
        world. Either way, we'd better get along”. Now, though, Elven friendliness is
        rare, and most elves despise the sight of another one. The power struggle to
        see who truly is the master of the dream has become intense. Some old elves
        blame the younger ones for the Sky Fire and Shadow Moon, claiming that too many
        competing for the dream has threatened to tear it apart.

            Elven bodies are formed from the aether by willpower alone. An elf that dies in
            Near returns within 28 days. The Story Guide and the player cooperate in
            choosing the time and the place; a story-relevant solution is preferred, but
            note that nobody has ever seen an elf rematerialize. The character loses a
            level from each Pool and a level from all Abilities, as the process of
            rematerialization is not perfect and the elf needs to readjust to his new body.

            An elf with this secret can, through force of will, make the illusion of the

            appears the elf has become translucent and incorporeal. This lasts for one

            rated or imbued equipment in this way from ordinary items, which slowly grow
            towards perfection in the elf’s hands; instead of an Ability check, the elf
            slowly invests into the item, one xp per scene, until he’s happy with it. All

            An item with this Imbuement has developed a self-identity of the sort you’d

            the MEMORY IMBUEMENT, which it uses for free. Ego items do not normally have
            Pools or Keys, but can use those of their operator. The item has no limit to
            its number of Imbuements. Requirement: two ELVEN IMBUEMENTS
          %dt Key of the Self
          %dd
            The character is an elf, a creature aloof and alone. 1xp: Ignore another

            pursue your own goals. Buyoff: Become human by either dying to save another or
            creating life.
          %dt Key of the Eternal Question (specify)
          %dd
            There is a reason behind the illusion that is Near, and the character cannot
            have peace before knowing what it is. Pick a specific question, such as “Is
            individual virtue more important than communal well-being?” or “Why can’t I
            remember what happened to me at the south pole just before the Skyfire hit?”
            1xp: Obsess over the question. 3xp: Apply the question to your practical

          %dt Key of Deja Vu
          %dd
            The character has experienced much, to the brink of ennui. 1xp: You’ve already
            experienced something that happens to you. 3xp: Your prior experience actually
            has an effect on the scene. Buyoff: Have a completely new experience.
          %dt Key of the Bloodline
          %dd
            No elf alive remembers their humanity, but some do know their bloodline, and
            watch their distant descendants with interest. 1xp: Observe your bloodline.

        “Elves are assholes” is a joking dictum that’s been developed through my own
        play. The experience probably has plenty to do with the fact that an empathetic
        elf would succumb to the Grey Age, leaving only the distant sociopaths and
        analytic personalities to seek Enlightenment.
      %p
        Still, everybody is a person, and so are the elves. I’ve seen amiable ones and
        even those that seek to actively do good. The last ones are most strained by
        their identity, as the question is awful: when you are dedicated to an eternal
        mission, is there anything in the world worth your sacrifice? Saving another
        person, even a good one, would mean nothing in comparison to your own eternity,
        whatever the cause you serve.
      %p
        Elves tend to be wanderers who don’t really call any land or culture their own.
        Thus their relationship to the world is more a matter of how the society reacts
        to the idea of elf than anything else.

          is good for elves, as they will find ready employment in the courts for their
          unique skills and knowledge of the past. The only danger is that the elf might
          be seen as a potential pretender to the throne in a culture obsessed with
          lineage and noble blood.

    %p
      A goblin is a small, twisted creature. A human would call it debased, for it
      has neither values nor restraint. The goblin would not understand those terms:
      it is a creature of hedonistic pleasure, living for this moment, and the next.
    %p
      Goblins are infinitely adaptable beings; their “natural” bodies, if you can
      call them that, manage to resemble demons, dogs, and men at the same time. They
      are mottled brown, black, green, and grey, and their hair grows randomly, in
      shape and color. Their bodies have an ability that cannot be explained by many:
      they evolve to match their environment even as they continue to age, and their
      offspring carry these same characteristic. Even strong magic and torture can
      warp their bodies, as many evil wizards have found, creating the dread
      urgoblins, bugbears, Hungry Ones and Violators from goblin stock. Most goblins
      are smaller and stouter than humans, although they can come in just about any
      size.
    %p
      Goblins' curiosity drives them into all the forgotten places of the earth, and
      makes them decent apprentices for just about any job: they catch on quickly,
      but tend to cause as many accidents as they do help. They're easy to keep
      loyal, though: all goblins have an addiction, which if fed regularly, will make
      one your best friend. This addiction need not be to a drug: they can be
      addicted to a certain act, food, drink, or any experiences, really. (A tale has
      been told of goblin divers on the shores of Maldor. These beasts were amazing
      pearl-finders, and were addicted to the rush of adrenaline they got when their
      human handler threw them off the cliff-side.)
    %p
      Goblin tribes can be found all over Near, and goblins may also easily live with
      humans who would have them. The regional variants in the appearance of the
      goblins are large, suggesting some regularity in their ancestry.

        %dt Secret of the Goblin
        %dd
          Goblins are all gripped by addictions that control much of their being, even
          being addicted to things that are in no way alluring to humans. The character
          does not pay Advances for the SECRET OF ADDICTION. The Story Guide may require
          Resist (R) checks from a goblin to avoid developing new addictions to
          experiences they encounter; each existing and active addiction provides a bonus
          die to resisting new ones.
        %dt Adaptability (V)
        %dd
          Goblins can change their body structure and even their mental build over time,
          although for most it is more of an instinctual than intentional process. The
          Ability can be used to perform feats of contortionism, both actual and
          metaphorical. The goblin might even be able to change his hair or skin color
          with enough motivation.
        %dt Secret of Adaptability
        %dd
          The character can change himself quickly and drastically to conform better with
          his current environment. When indulging an addiction, instead of regaining
          Pool, swap the level of ADAPTABILITY (V) with any other Ability. The change is
          permanent.
        %dt Secret of Deep Adaptation
        %dd
          In lieu of the normal activation of the SECRET OF ADAPTABILITY the character
          can regain Advances from Pools, Abilities and Secrets, and invest free Advances
          to the same very quickly. An ADAPTABILITY (V) check result determines how many
          Advances can be freed or invested. Cost: 2 VIGOR Requirements: SECRET OF
          ADAPTABILITY
        %dt Secret of Quick Adaptation
        %dd
          While other goblins usually do not warp into new form, the character adapts all
          but instantly. Furthermore, he may trigger an adaptation cycle at will. There
          is a downside: the Story Guide may cause an adaptation cycle to trigger when
          conditions suddenly change, should the character fail an ENDURE (V) check to
          control himself; if the addiction can’t be immediately satisfied, this costs
          Pool. Cost: 3 VIGOR to trigger adaptation. Requirements: SECRET OF ADAPTABILITY
        %dt Secret of Ravenous Hunter
        %dd
          The character can smell things that satisfy his severe addictions, even if they
          do not normally carry a smell. REACT (I) can be used to make checks to this
          purpose. Requirement: SECRET OF ADDICTION
        %dt Secret of Connoisseur (specify)
        %dd
          The character has become an expert on the subject of one of his addictions. He
          can use the Pool associated with the addiction freely for bonus dice on any
          Ability checks where this knowledge would be useful. Requirement: SECRET OF
          ADDICTION
        %dt Secret of Animalism
        %dd
          The character’s form has become recognizably animal-like. He can use animal
          crunch freely, as if he were beastkin himself.
        %dt Secret of the Chameleon
        %dd
          The character’s skin changes color at will or instinctively to match the
          environment. He can use his ADAPTABILITY (V) when trying to hide from others.
          Requirement: SECRET OF ANIMALISM
        %dt Secret of the Fur

          The character has a thick, warm fur that makes him both pretty and able to
          survive in cold environments. Weather is of no concern to him. Requirement:
          SECRET OF ANIMALISM
        %dt Secret of Ur-Pattern (specify)
        %dd
          The goblin has become locked into an UrPattern, reducing his adaptability
          considerably: each adaptation cycle now changes the character for one Advance’s
          worth (with larger changes done in parts). He also gains the specified Ur-Form
          for free. His progeny will all have the Ur-Form for free.
        %dt Trollish Ur-Form
        %dd
          A troll shakes off any compulsions when indulging his addiction, realizing his
          true course. As long as he follows the course, he may support his social
          Abilities with his ADAPTATION (V). Trolls are large and powerful, and may learn
          STATURE (V) and SECRET OF BULK.
        %dt Ghoulish Ur-Form
        %dd
          Ghouls almost always are addicted to the flesh of dead people; each time they
          consume it, the character has to resist the addiction. A ghoul consuming a dead
          person’s body gains a free Effect off his ADAPTATION (V) based on the person’s
          life. Thus the ghoul learns the tale of his dinner.
        %dt Deep One Ur-Form
        %dd
          Deep Ones can breathe both air and water, although they suffer a penalty die on
          physical tasks out of the water. They move very efficiently in water, gaining
          superior LEVERAGE in comparison to human swimmers.
        %dt Orcish Ur-Form
        %dd
          Orcs have a dark side and an inclination for brutality; each time they
          experience war, they have to resist addiction. An orc who would be losing a
          conflict or failing an Ability check can try again with ENDURE (V) by taking a
          1st level Harm.
        %dt Secret of the Ur-Goblin
        %dd
          The character can possess several URFORMS (bought as Secrets), but he cannot
          use the SECRET OF ADAPTABILITY at all. His progeny will all have the SECRET OF
          URPATTERN for free once for each of his Ur-Forms. Requirement: SECRET OF
          UR-PATTERN
        %dt Key of Affliction
        %dd
          The character suffers of the Affliction, which means that he pines over a love
          for a specific person, without quite understanding his condition himself. 1xp:
          Pine for your love. 2xp: Learn about love. 5xp: Get insulted, ostracized or
          ridiculed due to your state. Buyoff: Become a human by either beating your
          addictions or winning the love of your target.
        %dt Key of Identity
        %dd
          The character is not certain of who or what he is, anymore. 1xp: Your identity
          is questioned. 2xp: Your identity is asserted. 5xp: Reinvent yourself from
          physical appearance down. Buyoff: Settle down.
        %dt Key of Indulgence
        %dd
          The character knows how to enjoy life without going too far about it. 1xp:
          Indulge yourself, not your addictions. 3xp: Resist your addiction. Buyoff: Gain
          an addiction.
        %dt Key of Parenting
        %dd
          A goblinet or several have imprinted on the character as their parent. This
          happens to goblins from time to time, especially if they live with a tribe.
          1xp: Goblinets in the scene. 2xp: Care for the goblinets. 5xp: A goblinet grows
          up and leaves. Buyoff: Refuse the goblinets.
        %dt Key of Goblinet
        %dd
          Little goblins get this Key when they’re born. They usually buy it off when
          they become sexually mature. 1xp: Emulate another goblin. 3xp: Learn a new

      %p
        Left alone, goblin societies resemble anarchy to any outsider, although they
        tend to grow an alpha goblin among any tribe. Any goblin tribe of more than
        about two dozen of the animals tends to fall apart without an outside master,
        usually human. Goblins are actually rather good at organizing to make sure
        everyone's needs get met, but when they start to threaten each other's
        resources, tribes quickly split into rivals.
      %p
        Goblin families are very loose-knit. All goblins are poly-sexual, and any
        mating between them, whether male-male, male-female, or female-female, can
        generate offspring. With a month-long gestation period, this doesn't really get
        in the way of their curious relations.
      %p
        The goblin offspring are born as small, but capable goblinets, emerging as
        little flesh-balls about a foot in diameter. Within an hour of their birth,
        they grow feet, hands, eyes, and a mouth. Young goblinets pick another goblin
        in the tribe as their parent, randomly, and if that goblin doesn't push them
        away, they usually learn the same addictions and behaviors. Should it become an
        issue, goblinets begin the game with minimal Pools, their few Abilities at
        MEDIOCRE (0) and the KEY OF GOBLINET.
      %p
        Goblins do not understand the human concept of love. It's an alien concept to
        them. They do understand mutual pleasure, of both the sexual and non-sexual
        form, and do actively work with each other. The greatest sins in goblin society
        are not wanting to trade – one goblin's poison is another's pudding – and
        betraying someone you're working with.
      %p
        A few goblins have been observed in a bizarre state that resembles love,
        however. When a goblin is struck with this, known only as “the Affliction” in
        their rough language, they leave their tribe and travel, their only goals to
        prove their love or die. (They seem confused by their own emotions, and usually
        cannot express clearly what they are doing.) A goblin has never been observed
        in love with another goblin, however; they always choose a member of another
        species as their object of affection, almost always a human.
      %p
        A goblin who buys off the KEY OF AFFLICTION becomes human. They lose their
        Adaptability and goblin-specific Secrets (losing the Advances), but may not
        necessarily lose all of their current adaptations; such a person may be left
        stuck in a liminal state as they are unable to shapeshift.

        Goblin adaptability makes them a creature on par with humanity in terms of
        variation. Different conditions – and sometimes, cultures – force the goblins
        to take shapes quite far from what might be considered their natural one. It’s
        pretty fun to develop these critters from traditional fantasy memes; here are
        some examples:
      %dl.docutils

          are what goblins are called in the jungles of Qek. They live in troops deep in

          will almost always include a seamless extent of speaking and tool-using
          critters, as well as those that are little but dumb animals.
        %dt Orcs
        %dd
          are big, savage goblins that have sprung up in northern Maldor and Ammeni
          through the recent years. They are cruel, addicted to the by-products of war
          ravaging their homelands. Orcs seem to develop spontaneously in goblin tribes,
          but at their worst they are in the Ammeni mercenary outfits, made up entirely
          of orcs.
        %dt Ghouls
        %dd
          are goblins as well, gaunt as they may be. Ghouls apparently developed during
          the Year of Shadow and quickly specialized in scavenging the flesh of the
          multitudes that perished. Now they haunt battlefields and cemeteries in Maldor.
          Despite the environs and diet, most ghouls are gentle and curious creatures not
          likely to attack living beings.
        %dt Trolls
        %dd
          are what goblins are called in Gorenite lands. There are also actual trolls:
          strong, enormous, thickskinned rulers of troll-kin. It is far from clear why
          there are so many trolls in Goren of all places.
        %dt Spriggan
        %dd
          is what goblins are called in Khale. They’re shy creatures that live up in

          environment, making them quite reclusive.
        %dt Yeti

          is the name Vulflanders give to goblins. Vulfland goblins have thick, warm fur

          glacial labyrinths they trap against their Vulfen predators.
        %dt Deep Ones
        %dd
          are water-breathing goblins, of course. I imagine they’d interact with
          land-lubbers near coasts and in the archipelagos. Their undersea skirmishes
          with the Talalag of Pere-di-Fey must be a sight to behold.
        %dt Imps
        %dd
          are a particular type of goblin in Ammeni, the sort that is especially suited
          for specialized tasks in harmony with their form and addictions. The definition
          is really just functional, a useless goblin is a “pest” instead. Creating imps
          is something of an art-form among some more debased House nobles, who pride
          themselves on their ability of reducing a person into a flesh automaton.

      tradition to constrain and regulate the limitless passion, turning it into
      patience and a heritage. Dwarven community is like a cornucopia of strange
      mystery cults scattered all over the world, cults that recognize each other by
      secret languages, signs and tradition.

        %a#dwarven-rings{:name => "dwarven-rings"} Dwarven Rings
      %p
        Dwarves live for their community, most of the time. A dwarf calls his social
        ties “rings”, as they connect dwarves to each other and intersect to create the
        mesh of larger community. Humans are rarely accepted by dwarven rings, other
        species even less often.
      %p
        The first ring for any dwarf is his FAMILY, the immediate working unit that
        stands or falls together. All family members know their place in the family;
        the one with the most respect is called the family ALDER, who speaks for them
        all. Disobedience towards the alder is certain to split the family.
      %p
        When several families find it well to cooperate, they form a CLAN, ruled by a
        THANE. Just like family members have their places in a family, families have in
        a clan. Additionally, individual dwarves may hold a place in the thane’s ring
        as clansmen, which might afford them greater prestige than merely being a
        member of a family within the clan.
      %p
        This series of rings goes up to DOMAINS, ruled by KINGS, and finally the
        FEDERATION, ruled by the HIGH KING himself. Not only has the dwarven
        federation, parallel to the Empire of Maldor, disintegrated into kinstrife, but
        most if not all dwarven domains have also been lost; only clans and scattered
        families remain in Near today.
      %p
        Aside from the vertical organization of family rings, dwarves also organize
        laterally into GUILDS, ruled by the GUILDMASTER. The guildmaster is like an
        alder, except that his ring is not connected by blood, but by craft. A single
        dwarf can belong in several guilds as long as he has the time for it; the
        SECRET OF DWARF limits how many rings the character can have without additional
        Secrets.
      %p
        The smallest dwarven ring, and the most infamous, is that of BROTHERHOOD: in
        some specific circumstances a dwarven character might be obligated to offer the
        highest privilege to a friend or ally. This practice, while unavoidable in many
        legends, is a cause of great disruption and concern for dwarven society, and is
        therefore frowned upon when offered lightly.
      %p
        In practice the dwarven rings make for a seclusive community. When dwarves live
        in human towns, they do so in their own quarters. When they live in the wild,
        they form their homesteads in places hard to reach, if at all possible. Often a
        dwarven ring has an assigned speaker whose job it is to deal with humans and
        anybody else other strangers who do not belong in rings; this is considered a
        very stressful task, fraught with unseen danger.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#ordination-to-purpose{:name => "ordination-to-purpose"} Ordination to Purpose
      %p
        The central function of dwarven rings is to practice ORDINATION, the
        prioritization of dwarven wills in the rightful manner. Ordination is always
        between two dwarves, always explicit, but it is transitive: those who are
        lesser than I are also lesser than any towards whom I am the lesser. A dwarf of
        lesser ordination is expected to defer to the greater in all things, as that is
        what ordination means. Ordination is normally permanent, making older dwarves
        very likely to establish ordination towards younger ones at a very early age;
        only conflicting ordinations through multiple rings cause dwarves to re-examine
        the ordination of individuals. Dwarves of separate rings cannot normally
        negotiate ordination, which makes them strangers.
      %p
        As to why dwarves need these stringent structures, it is because of their
        PURPOSE, the mental state of each dwarf individually. Dwarves are by nature
        fanatics, each focusing on a single purpose to the exclusion of everything
        else. The ordination into rings makes it possible for the dwarves to interact
        and cooperate meaningfully with those whose interests coincide with theirs. A
        dwarf whose purpose does not brook ordination to their family often becomes
        outcast and either finds a new family or learns to live on his own.
      %p
        What all of this comes to is that dwarven families all over Near vary widely in
        their goals, lifestyle and philosophy. This may lead to a greater and greater
        seclusion for those families that do not have reasonable contact with other,
        amiable families. As most dwarves are keenly aware of the dangers of incest,
        this becomes an issue: it is not unknown for dwarves to steal human children to
        raise as their own, or to arrange for dwarfmeets wherein families with
        perpendicular interests exchange babies. This whole issue is a major reason for
        starting a clan or even a domain.
      %p
        Dwarves wield no magics foreign to men, but their mind-set is perhaps all the
        more alien. Dwarven rings live in a tension that demands absolute fealty from
        individuals whose first instinct is to trust nobody with their secrets and
        goals. They often have secret languages that are trained and memorized by
        habit, all the better to protect the secrets and purpose of the family. Dwarven
        equipment is often superior to anything else, and often much too cumbersome,
        complex or delicate for a human to use effectively.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#rituals{:name => "rituals"} Rituals
        %p
          Dwarven rings often practice various RITUALS, complex and codified surrogate
          actions towards definite goals. Mechanically rituals are exactly like equipment
          – invocation costs, equipment ratings and all – except that they are immaterial
          instead of being items. Dwarves do not distinguish much between a ritual and a
          piece of equipment: craftsmen of material make tools for a purpose, while
          craftsmen of the mind make tools for the mind. Such is typical for musicians,
          speakers, priests and storytellers, but nearly any Ability can be the basis of
          a ritual concerning its own slice of life.
        %p
          Each ritual is designed for a particular ring tongue, without which it cannot
          be understood. A character can teach a ritual to another if both succeed in
          FAMILIA (R) checks and belong in the same ring that has a ring tongue through
          which the particular ritual can be transmitted and used. A ritual smith can
          modify a ritual he knows with appropriate Ability checks, paying for the
          changes just like if he was creating a new ritual.
        %p
          A ritual always has a definite interval at which it needs to be repeated for
          the benefits to remain with the dwarf. When designing new rituals, consider
          making the ritual’s requirements or drawbacks more severe for rituals that do
          not require as much repetition.

        %a#living-for-a-reason{:name => "living-for-a-reason"} Living for a Reason
      %p
        Dwarves lived traditionally below-ground, in places others would not want or
        need. Through the latter years of the Empire of Maldor the dwarven domains
        unified in purpose as well, forming a strange parallel society largely hidden
        from human view. At this time trade and cooperation with humans was at its
        height as well, resulting in the underground domains (the original meaning of
        the word) becoming some of the most beautiful and prosperous cities in all of
        Maldor.
      %p
        The Shadow brought a time of disunity and kin strife to the dwarves as those
        individuals, families and even clans obsessed with the Skyfire and the science
        of astrology flew into confusion and rage. Trade relations with surface people
        deteriorated and underground domains were abandoned as families scattered to
        sustain themselves without trade. The federation was lost as the High King
        passed into darkness.
      %p
        Today many dwarves still insist on living underground, even if it is hard: an
        individual family is little better than a rodent in its hole, with cold and
        dirty environs that protect them from the world. Underground clans have more
        reasonable arrangements, but still most dwarves today end up living with people
        in their own walled enclaves or homesteads away from the human village. For
        most this is not a bad life, despite their inborn distrust of humanity: dwarven
        craftsmen and other specialists, all according to their purpose, certainly have
        their place in most parts of Near.
      %p
        Sometimes a dwarf stops to reflect on his ultimate, perfect fidelity of
        purpose. Sometimes the scales even balance against continuing a life of
        austerity among people who might not even be friends, despite being family.
        Such dwarves might seek to escape the life, although the risks are high: most
        dwarven communities tell stories of the horrible, twisted PETTY-DWARVES,
        creatures crushed under the burden of purpose without the support of their
        family. Even if this does not deter the would-be apostate, they probably know
        that each and every one of their rings will do something to get them back.
      %p
        Provided that their family does not retrieve them and they manage to buy off
        the KEY OF APOSTASY, escaping dwarves become human. Such characters forget any
        dwarven languages they had in time (unless preserved by SECRET OF LANGUAGE) and
        lose their position in dwarven rings (losing the Advances invested). They even
        gain height and walk more upright when they are no longer burdened by purpose.

            The character belongs in a number of dwarven rings at most equal to a FAMILIA
            (R) check, made into a free Effect associated with this Secret. He can
            determine ordinance with his ring-fellows, and may share Pools with them by
            simple companionship. Players may assume for simplicity’s sake that a character
            has a FAMILIA (R) check’s worth of points available in this manner at any given
            time; the obligation runs both ways, though.
          %dt Familia (R)
          %dd
            Knowledge of family history and values is of utmost importance to a dwarf.
            Aside from knowledge checks, this Ability is used to determine ORDINATION
            within a dwarven family. Ideological issues and family policy are also debated
            mostly with this Ability.
          %dt Secret of Purpose
          %dd
            The character has a personal PURPOSE in harmony with those of his rings. He may
            convert experience points into Pool points of his choice.
          %dt Secret of Alder
          %dd
            The character is the head of a family of dwarves, forming a family ring. By
            definition, he needs to have the highest ordination, others are expected to
            either relinquish ordination to him or leave the family. The alder phrases the
            family’s overall purpose. Requirements: SECRET OF PURPOSE
          %dt Secret of Guildmaster
          %dd
            The character is the head of a dwarven guild. Guilds are like families, except
            that they count ordination with an appropriate craft Ability instead of FAMILIA
            (R). A dwarf may belong in both a family and a guild, and a guild may have
            members of several families. The guildmaster is treated like an alder for the
            purposes of other crunch if the guild has members of several families; like a
            thane if it has members from several clans and so on. Requirements: SECRET OF
            PURPOSE
          %dt Secret of Thane
          %dd
            The character leads several dwarven families as a thane, forming a clan ring.
            Alders of the clan automatically belong in the clan ring and determine family
            ordination against each other and individual dwarves in the clan ring; dwarves
            in the clan families may use this family ordination when they do not have any
            mutual rings. Requirements: SECRET OF PURPOSE, three alders willing to obey the
            thane.
          %dt Secret of Brotherhood (person)

            The character shares his ordination with another; the two characters are
            considered of equal ordination, a concept otherwise unknown to dwarven society.
            The target of brotherhood may make free use of the rings of this character; the
            two are considered spiritually and legally same by other dwarves, to such an
            extent that one killing the other would not be seen as murder, but as
            self-amputation.
          %dt Secret of True Brothers (person)

            The two characters are bonded not only in form, but in spirit as well. Either
            may use the other’s Secrets when the two are together, and now both characters
            can use the rings of either character interchangeably. Cost: 1 POOL appropriate
            to the Secret. Requirement: the target has a matching SECRET OF BROTHERHOOD.
          %dt Secret of Ring Tongue (specify)
          %dd
            The character has invented a secret language supporting a particular ring’s
            purpose. The player gets to choose one Ability that gains a bonus die to all
            characters that learn the language. Members of the ring learn it automatically
            within a year and a day of its release at the latest, and need no Secrets to
            know it. Others need the SECRET OF LANGUAGE.
          %dt Secret of Ringcraft
          %dd
            The character has learned secrets that are not even expressible in natural
            languages, which lack the necessary grammar. He can create equipment and
            rituals using any Ability a ring tongue of his supports, just like if he had
            the SECRET OF CREATION. All equipment created by him has the DWARVEN IMBUEMENT
            for free.
          %dt Dwarven Imbuement (language)
          %dd
            All dwarven items have this imbuement, reflecting their stark, alien function.
            The item’s creator chooses one ring tongue for which the equipment has been
            designed; users of that ring tongue pay any introduction costs the item has
            only once per session, instead of per scene. An item may have this imbuement
            several times to make it usable for several languages.
          %dt Secret of the Wondersmith (theme)
          %dd
            The character has become a master of his craft, creating new things in
            obsession. Equipment and rituals created by the character do not need to be
            mundane, and may in fact be built to use any Secret mechanics in the game as
            long as they follow the THEME: the wondersmith has to choose a particular
            material, topic or function he specializes in, and all of his wondrous
            creations have to accord with it. The character can take this Secret several
            times to broaden his horizons, of course. Cost: An additional 1 INSTINCT per
            magical rating and 2 INSTINCT per magical Imbuement. Requirements: SECRET OF

            The war-dance of this dwarven clan in Qek helps them remove the heads of the
            unworthy to store zamani in. It allows the dwarf to use the SECRET OF SUDDEN
            STRIKE. The ritual remains in effect until the next time the dwarf sleeps.
            Ratings: +3 for removing the heads of the wicked. +2 for removing heads. +1 for

            The character can use FAMILIA (R) as a social Ability to issue orders to others

        Dwarves are a minority even among their own kind. I imagine them as crazy
        survivalists, cultists, esoteric experts of forgotten arts. A dwarven family
        could form the kernel of a human organization – and that organization could
        even have heroic goals. Perhaps this would justify the state of the dwarf.
      %p
        My own favorite dwarves live burrowed in certain white cliffs on the southern
        continental coastline. They are the Domain of Kruse, just about the last
        dwarven Domain in Near, thanks to how they closed themselves away from the
        world when the Skyfire came. The whole domain is dedicated to Luxembourgian
        revolutionary communism, which makes them relatively nice when compared to the
        average sort of foreign colonist in Near. The fearsome thing is that their
        social model works for them, being dwarves, and they don’t mind sharing the
        system with others. Fun times.
      %p
        Goren is as much of a haven for dwarves as it is for the other critters;
        dwarven smith families are core value for the guild towns of Old Goren, and
        people know more or less how to handle the dwarves thanks to numerous lays that
        tell about heroes, magic rings and what dwarves do to you if you commission
        magical artifacts and don’t pay for them.
      %p
        Any place in Near is good for dwarves, considering how esoteric their purposes
        can get and what sort of lifestyles they’re willing to adopt. There hasn’t been
        much play yet, but I’ve heard about dwarven scholars in the Lost Academy,
        farmer communities in the Oranide hills, rebel survivalists on the Abandoned
        Coast of Maldor, religious fanatic dwarves of all seven sorts and so on and so
        forth.

      %em Adapted from forum discussions with Josh and Troels.
    %p
      Giants, as the name implies, are a large, human-like species scattered all over
      Near. They vary widely in size from ten-foot brutes to beings capable of
      felling mammoths by hand. Stories tell of even larger giants, big enough to
      cast a shadow over a whole city and strong enough to lift castles off the
      ground.
    %p
      Giants do not look pretty: their musculature knots like tree roots under their
      skin, with bones jutting at unpractical angles. Thick layers of dirt cake them
      where their arms can’t reach to keep them clean; sometimes vegetation grows
      directly on their thick, unfeeling skin. Most are hairy and naked by necessity.
      Still, the lumbering creature works even as it creaks, rising with an
      earthquake to shout its rage.

      %p
        Giants are rare creatures, as often born of the Human Equation as naturally;
        they do start families, but only in the most distant parts of the world, such
        as the Roof of the World or Vulfland tundra. Elsewhere a giant is much more
        likely to be hunted down long before he meets his match.
      %p
        This is not to say that people are hostile towards giants; for most they are
        little more than stories of far past, so rare these creatures are. Giants are
        not essentially hostile, either – they have a human-like intelligence and
        aesthetic, they enjoy the same thing humans do.
      %p
        What makes this association so painful and impossible is the size of the giant,
        both physically and psychologically: giants eat a lot and often have little
        patience or care for those smaller than themselves. Stories know to warn of
        this: giants are depicted as buffoons or hostile rogues in many places. Living
        with the “little people” is simply too much of a challenge for most. Think of
        KING KONG, that’s the sort of thing you’d get most of the time trying to
        interact with a giant.

            Giants are much larger than most people. When a giant can make his size count
            in conflict, he can annul the result by flexing himself; this does not by
            itself cause a simple conflict to extend, but if it does, the opposition cannot
            benefit from SURPRISE bonus dice. However, there is a price: the giant heals
            slowly, and any Harm he has at the end of extended conflict goes up one step
            (to a maximum of MORTAL (6)) instead of shaking down. Cost: check difference in

            check of this Ability can be used to find out if a giant is “large enough” for
            a given purpose. I’m thinking of things like ripping trees from their roots or
            lifting a person on a rooftop. The Ability is also useful as support in
            anything where large size and strength would be of use.
          %dt Secret of Soft Touch
          %dd
            The character has learned to restrain himself when interacting with lesser
            creatures. His STATURE associates with INSTINCT as well, and he can buy penalty
            dice for it as well as bonus dice, should he wish to intentionally reduce the
            impact of his size on the environment.
          %dt Secret of Temper
          %dd
            The character has awakened his AURA. The character can shake off any social or
            magical compulsion by going into a rage; this does not by itself cause a simple
            conflict to extend, but if it does, the opposition cannot benefit from SURPRISE
            bonus dice. However, there is a price: anybody refreshing Pools with the giant
            is prone to suffer Harm equal to a STATURE (V) check when interacting
            intimately with his unrestrained nature; a REACT (I) check from the victim can
            be used to reduce the amount of Harm. Cost: check difference in Instinct to
            shake off the result.
          %dt Secret of Chaos Aura
          %dd
            The character’s very movement causes a disturbance within his aura. Elven auras
            are suppressed in the presence of the giant, unless the elf succeeds in a
            RESIST (R) check against his STATURE (V). When the character rages, others
            nearby have to make REACT (I) checks against his STATURE (V) to regain their
            balance. Requirement: SECRET OF TEMPER
          %dt Secret of the Evil Eye
          %dd
            The character’s eye holds such power that it kills on sight. Using the eye
            enables mortal stakes in conflict. A RESIST (R) check against his STATURE (V)
            may be used to resist. The eye cannot be turned off. Requirement: SECRET OF
            TEMPER
          %dt Secret of Colossal Size
          %dd
            The character is of an older breed, of a clearly larger scale than the average
            giant. He can feasibly use his STATURE (V) for Gulliver-style feats, such as
            damming rivers with his body. He also has superior LEVERAGE in conflicts where
            his size matters; he wins wrestling matches and such automatically against
            lesser creatures. However, the colossal giant does not recover normally: he
            cannot use natural healing or plain Ability checks to heal Harm. Requirements:
            SECRET OF TEMPER, more SECRET OF BULK than any other character in the campaign
            has at the moment.
          %dt Secret of Deep Sleep
          %dd
            The character’s rest is deep and healing. By forgoing a refreshment opportunity
            and sleeping instead, he can shake down all of his Harm and make a STATURE (V)
            check to heal a level. Waking up to disturbance requires a RESIST (R) check.
          %dt Secret of the Sleep of Seasons
          %dd
            The giant can go into a long, deep sleep. The sleeping giant is considered a
            part of the landscape by the fauna and flora, and will not care for sustenance
            nor conditions of his environment while he sleeps. The sleeping giant can
            awaken by being Harmed or with a successful REACT (I) check in reaction to
            considerable disturbance; otherwise he continues sleeping indefinitely. The
            sleeping giant is healed of all Harm, and will not need sleep afterwards for
            however long the sleep of seasons lasted. Requirements: SECRET OF TEMPER,
            SECRET OF DEEP SLEEP.
          %dt Secret of the Giant Dream
          %dd
            The giant’s dream world is somewhat real, reflecting his experiences and
            knowledge welling from deep inside. The character may have normal scenes framed
            for him within his dream, in which he is human and not a giant. Anything may
            happen to the character mechanically in the dream, except that dying in the
            dream ends the sleep. Requirements: SECRET OF DEEP SLEEP
          %dt Secret of Encompassing Dream
          %dd
            The giant’s dream influences the place of his rest in subtle ways. The spot
            becomes a soft place of dream shamanism. The player of the giant can describe
            how natural forces and happenstance shape the terrain. In any scene happening
            in the place, the player can make a STATURE (V) check for a pool of dice,
            usable as bonus or penalty Gift Dice for anything happening in the scene.

          %dd
            The sleeping giant’s consciousness can possess the form of an animal in his
            place of dreaming. The giant is still dreaming, so the avatar’s actions are
            non-aware, even if full of intent. If the giant’s spot is a soft place, he can
            also manifest in a elemental shape or plant life. Requirements: SECRET OF DEEP

            The character is like a Disney movie protagonist, earnestly looking for his
            place in the world. 1xp: Cause humiliating trouble by being clumsy or
            inconsiderate. 2xp: Complain to a friend about how inconsiderate other people

        %a#adult-temper{:name => "adult-temper"} Adult Temper
      %p
        Giants vary in size quite a bit, usually growing larger as they get older.
        Giants themselves do not look at size as the first thing, however: rather, a
        giant is only considered an adult once his TEMPER awakens.
      %p
        A giant’s Temper is not quite a natural thing from a human viewpoint: rather,
        it’s the awakening of the giant’s inhuman lusts and yearnings, like a beast
        within. Some giants fear their temper, and for a reason: it is not always
        controllable.
      %p
        An unawakened giant is much like a large human. When the Temper awakens,
        however, the giant gains an AURA of sorts: natural forces start manifesting
        around him, especially when he gets angry. The aura is a dark one, not easy to
        see; many would mistake it for grime or body hair, except when the giant rages
        and it crawls all over him. The aura magic provides the giant with elemental,
        brute power unmatched in this world.
      %p
        Born giants from the fringes of the world might sometimes talk of how they see
        themselves and their Temper. It is often a wistful story, one that touches on
        the First and the Ancient: when the world was made all was well, but ever since
        then people have started seeing farther and farther, which has made for less
        and less space for giants, who grow smaller and smaller, straining their Temper
        more and more. The First had no Temper, for they were permitted to grow as
        large as they would and could. What any of this means, I doubt a giant could
        say.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#sleep-of-seasons{:name => "sleep-of-seasons"} Sleep of Seasons
      %p
        Giants do not grow old, or at least there is no proof of such. They do,
        however, grow tired. As a giant grows larger and older he heals slower and
        needs more food and sleep. Ultimately, the giant may go into a long-term
        hibernation known as the sleep of seasons. This may last years, decades – even
        centuries, if the giant is not disrupted and he needs the time to heal. Earth
        and vegetation gather quickly to cover these giants; in fact, their own skin
        sheds and provides a starting point for the protective coloration. The breath
        and heart of such a giant slow down to such an extent that it may easily be
        mistaken for dead.
      %p
        Many places in modern Near are known as spots where a giant has presumably
        fallen, often during the chaos of the Skyfire or the Year of Shadow.
        Superstitious people tread lightly in these places, in fear of awakening the
        giant sleeping within the crust. Others seek these places in the hopes of
        awakening a powerful servant. Some worship giants, such as the eponymous King
        Khale of the Khaleans.
      %p
        A sleeping giant seems inactive, but this is not quite so: the giant dream is
        powerful and may influence the world in different ways. The most dramatic event
        is when the sleeping giant happens upon an AVATAR, a representative it contacts
        to advocate for itself in the waking world.
      %p
        A different form of the sleep of seasons is the sleep of rebirth, which may
        happen for dying giants who possess the Key of Temper. Unless his body is
        concernedly destroyed (not a mean task), the death of a giant may be near
        indistinguishable from his sleep. In time, the giant may awaken from this
        dream, provided that he succeeds in a STATURE (V) check: if he bought off the
        KEY OF TEMPER when he died, this rebirth happens in human form: the stony form
        of the dead giant opens to reveal the man inside. Such a character loses access
        to his giant crunch (not recovering Advances) and continues as a mortal.
        However, should a giant die in rage, he will only awaken from the sleep of
        death as a ONE-EYE, a dead, stony apparition driven by the giant’s unspoken
        appetite. Should a character not awake at all, the player decides when to let
        the dreaming afterlife of his character lapse.
      %p
        I should mention that there is one other way for a giant to become human
        through the KEY OF TEMPER buyoff: a giant who never rages will slowly diminish
        in size to match the people around him. This is a long and awkward process, but
        if he can build ties to a human community and keep his Temper in check, then a
        giant will one day find himself indistinguishable from the people around him.
        In practice I’d term this a QUEST if something is.

      %p
        One-Eyes are not properly characters; rather, they are echoes of true giants
        that have died, but refused to give way to new life. Such is the giant’s
        vitality that it animates earth and stone and weirder things to house the
        giant’s Temper. The One-Eye is an artificial colossus, a mockery of what the
        giant was like in life.
      %p
        One-Eyes, despite their origin, do not necessarily differ that much from living
        giants in their habits. If left in peace, they roam around, seemingly without
        aim, perhaps grabbing an animal and gnawing at it in imitation of hunger. They
        rest and wait as well, even if they need no sleep.
      %p
        A One-Eye can be dangerous to people who do not know what it is and provoke it;
        it has no morality, and it will not hesitate to squash small people under its
        bulk. Sometimes tragedies happen when a One-Eye ignores habitation and walks
        straight in, crushing everything in its way.
      %p
        One-Eyes were a much more common sight before the Skyfire, when Academy wizards
        of Maldor had found ways to influence them and even work them for the Empire.
        One-Eyes were once even collected and sent against the Hamouadi in a bid of
        desperation. This did not work too well, for the OneEyes then were tempestuous:
        whenever two of the kind would meet, they would fight to the utter destruction
        of both.
      %p
        When the Skyfire came, the One-Eyes all stopped moving as one. Soon they fell
        over and did not rise, becoming like the earth they came from. It’s taken
        centuries, but now these old One-Eyes are coming back, rising from the earth.
      %p
        One-Eyes today have an unspoken connection to each other. When rarely two of
        the kind should meet, they often start building structures, such as long walls
        that snake over the countryside, and stranger things besides. Nobody seems to
        know what they are doing.

      %p
        One-Eyes are not characters. In fact, they’re not even monsters like the
        forgotten dead, but more like furniture or natural phenomena. They are
        purposefully mysterious: whatever is going on with them, the answers are only
        found in play. I have my own theories, but I’m not telling.
      %p
        When a One-Eye is created, the giant’s last STATURE (V) check becomes an Effect
        that represents the One-Eye’s might. The player of the giant phrases the
        Effect, determining whatever scrap of the giant remains in his last creation.
        This Effect works exactly like any other, insofar as the rules are concerned.
        It just happens to be quite large in leverage, able to destroy fortresses that
        happen on its way. Characters will find it simple to destroy if they can match
        it’s rating with an appropriate Ability or outmaneuver it in some way.
      %p
        As the One-Eye is not an intentional creature, its Effect rating is only ever
        compared against a character’s check when the character gets directly in the
        One-Eye’s way. Otherwise the One-Eye mostly causes circumstance penalties or
        provokes simple Ability checks. In this regard it works exactly like a
        sandstorm or landslide or other natural disasters; in fact, the One-Eye is
        pretty much a fantasy disaster for the Story Guide’s toolbox.
      %p
        One-Eyes are more dangerous when they get numerous, especially now that they
        cooperate instead of fighting each other. There is a mud-flat in the eastern
        parts of the Sea of Teeth where a hundred One-Eyes struggle to break free from
        the slowly drying sea. When they do, who knows what they will do.

        of Near – Roof of the World, perhaps, or other places where giants can live in
        peace.
      %p
        In the civilized lands there is hardly any room for giants, whose bumbling
        ways, troublesome size and temperament are sure to make them enemies of
        organized government sooner or later. Merely existing among people of normal
        size is story enough for a giant; indeed, where giants have worked their feats
        of strength, they’ve rarely been anything but legendary figures.
      %p
        Goren is something of an exception to this rule in that the Gorenite Jošland
        has plenty of room for giants. Even in Old Goren probably half a dozen
        different families herd sheep in the frontier valleys and gorges of the Roof,
        journeying east to trade with Gorenite towns. The age-old ways tend to be
        disrupted by Highland Saints, however, as they have learned in the Roof to not

        Beastkin (anthropomorphized animals, furries – why not?) are mostly the same as
        humanite characters, mechanically. Each has a mandatory Secret that belongs to
        that creature only. They are not part of the Human Equation, however, and
        neither do they have any obvious relationship to each other, apart from the
        human-oriented view that they’re all “like animals”.
      %p
        Beastkin characters can access their own racial crunch, generic beastkin crunch
        and animal crunch freely. Like animals, the assumption is that a given

        SECRET OF SMALL SIZE for a large creature and so on.
      %p
        Beastkin are not psychologically or physically similar to humans like the old
        species are, so the Story Guide might well throw in some well-chosen
        circumstance penalties and such when the two breeds interact. Beastkin can

            pure force and speed. It’s not so much that this is the only important facet of
            being an animal; rather, we decide that dramatically the only reason animals

          %dd
            An animal with this Secret is usually awake at night, and has adapted to
            low-light conditions. The animal associates all of its Abilities with INSTINCT
            at night-time and does not receive circumstance penalties for lack of light.
          %dt Secret of Man-killer
          %dd
            The animal does not fear people. When fighting with BESTIALITY (V) against a
            member of the old species, any Harm it causes is increased one step, but not
            over MORTAL (6). Requirement: has killed a person.
          %dt Secret of Trad Animal
          %dd
            The old TSoY rule for animals is to give them any Secrets that make sense for
            them, sort of like how item imbuements work. You can do that here as well: have
            the animal use its BESTIALITY (V) or TRAINING (R) or Passive Abilities instead
            of the Abilities the Secret requires, of course.
          %dt Key of the Predator
          %dd
            The animal is predatory by instinct. 1 Pool: Lurk or roam. 2 Pool: Attack prey.
            3 Pool: Attack an unusual prey.
          %dt Key of Herding
          %dd
            The animal likes to live among its own kind. 1 Pool: Remain with your herd. 2
            Pool: Follow the herd’s lead. 3 Pool: Defend the herd.
          %dt Key of Nocturnality
          %dd
            The animal prefers being active at night. 1 Pool: Be in a scene at night. 2
            Pool: Refuse to come out in daylight. 3 Pool: Feed or mate at night.

              The equipment is an animal. The character may use his ANIMAL KEN (I) or other
              animalhandling Abilities in lieu of BESTIALITY (V) or other animal-only

              The equipment has a separate Pool. This mostly makes sense for animals, but
              there are other places in the book for this as well. The Pool is one point in
              size and can be used whenever the character uses the equipment, as whichever
              type of Pool. It replenishes when the equipment is maintained.
            %dt Secret of Beastmaster
            %dd
              The character can tame normally untamable creatures with his ANIMAL KEN (I),
              forcing them to take the SECRET OF TAMENESS. He can also make any animal he
              tames a sidekick with the SECRET OF SIDEKICK regardless of Ability levels. When
              he tames an animal that doesn’t have established statistics, the player gets to
              allocate his check’s worth of Advances for the animal, while the Story Guide
              allocates twice that.
            %dt Secret of Behavior (specify)

              The character gets along especially well with animals that have a certain

        The fauna of Near is just as varied as you’d expect of a good and nice fantasy
        world. The environs of the Sea of Teeth are particularly rich in all sorts of
        life, but everywhere in Near there are animals fitting the environment; some
        even say that this is what Hanish gave Near, a living biosphere.
      %p
        Animals are not intentional creatures, so they don’t get Motivation Keys. What
        they do get are BEHAVIOR KEYS:
      %blockquote
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Behavior Key Framework
          %dd
            Keys of this type depict inborn instincts. 1 Pool: Fulfill your routine. 2
            Pool: Struggle to fulfill your routine. 3 Pool: Fulfill your routine despite
            exceptional circumstances.
      %p
        As can be seen, Behavior Keys do not provide experience points (and do not have
        a Buyoff condition) – instead, they provide Pool points for whichever Pool is
        running the lowest at the moment. This is useful for animals, as they get only
        one Pool point from a normal Pool refreshment.
      %p
        The typical animal has very few Abilities; in fact, only Bestiality (V) and
        Passive Abilities are a given, while anything else depends on the animal’s
        nature. Pools are also likely to be low, with Reason practically non-existent.
        Animals usually can’t learn non-animal Secrets, although I do use the generic
        Secrets (SECRET OF SPECIALTY and whatnot) to depict important animal
        characteristics when I feel like it.
      %p
        Of course, most of the time animals are secondary characters run by the Story
        Guide, so it’s not very likely that these details would matter much. Still,
        there are some ways for player characters to access their animal side, too.

        Animals are tamed with ANIMAL KEN (I), simply enough. Most animals aren’t
        naturally tamable, though. For those that are, the player needs to choose how
        he wants to handle the animal as a game element:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          EQUIPMENT: animals might be made into equipment reasonably enough. The ANIMAL
          IMBUEMENT even allows the animal to act, sort of. The character could even
          become professional in training animals with the SECRET OF CREATION (ANIMAL
          KEN). This approach makes the animal a tool for the character; the animal won’t
          act independently nor possess individual interests.
        %li
          SIDEKICK: a tame animal, such as a horse, can be made into a sidekick with
          crunch appropriate to its nature. The character communicates with his
          sidekick with ANIMAL KEN (I) in this case, of course. A sidekick is assumed
          to not generate any drama by itself, so the Story Guide will have it get
          difficult only if abused or endangered. Note that the sidekick can’t use
          BESTIALITY (V) to support or directly aid the character; it needs to use
          TRAINING (R) for that.
        %li
          EXTRA: If the player doesn’t really care about an animal, it’s an extra and
          does not have mechanical impact on the game. It might still act as momentary
          leverage for the character, though, and be a cause for circumstance penalties
          and whatnot. An ANIMAL KEN (I) check may also be used on it easily enough to
          get an Effect or change it into equipment by declaration.
      %p
        In other words, quite straightforward once you remember that the same fictional
        thing need not have the same mechanics.

          skins are valuable. They have the SECRET OF SUDDEN STRIKE and they can’t be

          devouring snake is larger and meaner. The third one is poisonous snake, which
          delivers a potent natural infusion. All three snakes surprise the most careless
          victim, or the one with the worst Reason Pool. They will only let go if
          injured. The snake behaviors are PREDATOR and SOLITARY.

    %p
      The Imperial Age wrought many stories in Near, and brought some to wider
      knowledge, so that they would be repeated in all lands of the Empire and
      beyond. One loved by the people even after the Shadow is the romance of
      Andreth, whose songs are still sung today in the west.
    %p
      Andreth was the daughter of Arni, a great Lord of vast appetites and greater
      domains. Unusual for the time, Andreth was a trobairiz, singer of songs and
      teller of stories. Her wit pleased Arni, who would elsewise been likely to
      forbid all contact with the outside world from a daughter he was preserving for
      fine marriage.
    %p
      As a trobairiz Andreth was well-spoken and knowledgeable of all things of men,
      beasts and fair unseen. She carried herself proudly in court and dressed
      beautifully to accentuate her fair mien and lithe frame. It was justly said
      that her ways made her a fetching prize for whomever Arni would choose for her
      husband.
    %p
      Nadir at the time was a one of the Elven-kind, creatures known for their
      fickleness, immortality and fearsome magic. He was a wellknown companion to
      travelers high and low, for Nadir was always moving, never still. He was
      seeking for something, it was said, and he left many a philosopher and scholar
      in ruin when they could not satisfy his thirst for knowledge.
    %p
      Finally crossing the Wedge (a great bridge then built over two rivers it was),
      Nadir came to hear of fair Andreth of Hemmel and her wisdom. For reasons only
      known to himself Nadir then decided to match his wit against this woman.
    %p
      Arriving at Hemmel, Nadir was well received by Arni, who had grown puissant in
      the highland wars, but sought supernatural might as well. There Nadir also saw
      Andreth, who could hardly match him in fairness, but could, would and did
      answer each and every one of his questions. However, more questions were
      raised, and not only for Nadir, but for wise Andreth as well.
    %p
      After that first meeting Nadir would return to Hemmel several times. Each time
      Arni would court him in the hopes of allying himself with the fair folk; each
      time Nadir would demur, but in such a way that he would not offend the host.
      Arni, however, grew hungrier and badtempered over time.
    %p
      Andreth, on the other hand, stayed amiable yet distant to oftvisiting Nadir.
      They sparred in words and sat long into the night over old books, yet neither
      did Nadir leave her weeping with her wisdom wanting, nor did she scare him
      away.
    %p
      One time Nadir came back to Andreth with a gift of music: a harp of exquisite
      make, its strings of unbreakable steel. She looked upon it curiously before
      inquiring whether she was now to compete with the guest in song; matching
      strength against strength had been the reason of Nadir’s every visit in the
      past.
    %p
      But no, Nadir exclaimed then: it was to be a courtship present, for he had
      decided to be in love with this woman whose demeanor would not leave him even
      in the farthest reaches of Near, and of whom he now dreamed, when he had
      suffered of dreams never before.
    %p
      Nadir’s was not a fine amour, as Andreth came to learn: he would leave with no
      word and then return, sometimes against the knowledge of Arni, her father. In
      time, however, she came to expect his return and desire for their time
      together.
    %p
      What’s more, each time Nadir returned, he brought her a miraculous present.
      These gifts were of Nadir’s craft, for he was a maker of things, an Elven
      smith. Each, he said, were in equal part of him and her, through his image of
      her. Each time Andreth would return the favor to his paramour, gifting him with
      a new song; these songs, she said, were in equal part of her and him, through
      her image of him.
    %p
      In the meantime, Arni had grown still greater, becoming larger than other men.
      His patience was wearing thing even as his suspicions were fed by Andreth, who
      had become ever more distant to her tempestuous father.
    %p
      As a mighty Lord growing mightier still Arni traveled far and wide; first on
      horseback, later by his own stride, or pulled in great carriages. He was away
      often, and thus could not ascertain for himself his suspicions concerning the
      elusive Nadir.
    %p
      However, ultimately an opportunity came to him – or rather, he came to it, as
      Arni grew in determination and hired a magician to bewitch himself. Soon after,
      while traveling away from home, Arni had a dream of the elf on the escarpments
      of castle Hemmel. Fortified with his dream visitation, Arni knew to return
      home.
    %p
      Surprising the two lovers at his castle made Arni furious, but also satisfied,
      as now he knew that he could always trust his instincts in the matters of men
      and the Elven kind. Nadir he threw into a dark oubliette, Andreth was locked
      away in a tower; Arni would think long and hard on their punishment.
    %p
      As already established, Arni’s temper was awakened by the imagined slight to
      his honor. His rage doubled when he discovered the treasures of Nadir, and
      tripled when he discovered the songs written by his daughter; beautiful new
      things in the world, but not made for him.
    %p
      Finally, unable to come to decision, Arni made one anyway: he had the elf
      brought forward and told Nadir that he would deface and slay Andreth himself
      should the elf seek escape by his arts. Then he had Andreth brought forward and
      gave the two a cunning choice: one would have to die to calm the giant’s
      temper, but the choice would have to be in their hands. In this way Arni bound
      Nadir’s Elven magic to his own purposes.
    %p
      They say that later on Andreth and Nadir would live together in humility. To
      this day their progeny, considered Half-Elven, lives among men. They are much
      loved for their cunning craft and courteous manner, and the songs Andreth
      taught everybody to sing.
    %p
      More important still for many is the seeking of treasures: men in Maldor swear
      up and down that they’ve seen the magical harp, the mask and other things made
      by Nadir, still glowing bright golden, still with wondrous powers, proof of his
      love for Andreth.
