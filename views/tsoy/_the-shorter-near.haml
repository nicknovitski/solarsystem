  %p
    This movement begins with a general introduction to Near, but soon moves into
    Maldor, the ancient homeland of the Empire that ruled the world. The theme is
    feudalism and religion, as the children of the Moon in both human and animal
    shape strive to conquer what is left of the old ways.
  %p
    The fate of Maldor hangs in balance between the ancient order of the Sun Lord
    and the Queen of Shadow, a radical symbol of anarchy and change. Through her
    the old and tired land can experience a rebirth, if only it can weather the
    change. The Sun is championed by feudal lords and their armies, while the Queen
    has on her side women, beastkin, terrorists, revolutionaries and the people
    thoroughly tired of endless war.
  %p
    Amidst this Celestial struggle live people who have to choose between two
    impossible theologies to find any sort of succor. The endless war of Maldor may
    only be ended by arms, but so far none has proved up to the task.

          This character’s death is always a valid stake in conflict, regardless of
          propriety. When the character dies, the player gets to narrate how one part of
          Near fails; might be right here, might be far away, but something was depending
          on him. A part of the setting is now dead. Treat this as a transcendence
          narration insofar as the rest of the campaign is concerned. Requirement: only
          at character creation.

          The character refuses to let go, preferring to continue in the campaign: when
          the character makes a TRANSCENDENT (7) level success in an Ability check, the

      It has been 300 years since the SKYFIRE, a catastrophe that decimated the
      world. A giant asteroid ripped into the planet, forcing a part of it to
      separate into a large moon. Only luck and large mountain chains saved Near from
      the shockwave that obliterated most of the world. It still remains to be seen
      whether the broken world can sustain life indefinitely or whether the biosphere
      is doomed to perish as the atmosphere leaks into space or the continental
      plates realign catastrophically.
    %p
      Although the lands known as Near were largely protected from the immediate
      impact, the Year of Shadow that immediately followed decimated the agriculture,
      leading to nine tenths of the population perishing. The remaining people
      struggle with a lost culture and changed world, surviving at a subsistence
      level.
    %p
      Or that’s the pessimistic vision, anyway. In practice Near is a huge
      contradiction in play – I for one haven’t ever gone full-blown survivalist with
      this game, no matter how much TSoY flirts with realism mixed in with the
      fantasy. Just this last spring I started a new campaign, and the world
      certainly resembled nothing so much as the early medieval dark ages, complete
      with specialized service industries and money. This was simply what our group
      needed, we had no patience for exploring the implications of primitivism when
      our focus was on the clash of patriarchal society with wiccan theology.
    %p
      As you come to read this book, you’ll notice that it is full of contradictions
      like this. Near is only consistent in play, not in a book. The group is
      expected to pare down and creatively ignore anything that doesn’t fit their
      campaign, as well as invent answers for any open questions they encounter.

        Near is shadowed by the ROOF OF THE WORLD, a large mountain chain to the west.
        Everything falls into the great Eastern Sea on the other edge of the world. In
        between was the Empire of Maldor, the greatest civilization Near had ever
        known.
      %p
        As the Skyfire broke the world, many changes happened: new mountains rose,
        valleys fell into sea and the sky itself occluded, darkened by great clouds of
        dust. The Sea of Teeth ripped into the Northern part of Near, drowning much and
        separating the rest.
      %p
        Life in Near is for most people a constant struggle. The great majority of the
        people live in preliterate barter economies. The difference between cultures
        that survived the Year of Shadow as primitive hunter-gatherers and those that
        stockpiled technology into elaborate shelters is striking. It is now anybody’s
        guess as to how the world will shake out in the end.

        The Moon is a terrible curse for those who cling to the values and ways of the
        past. For those who look to the future and change it becomes a symbol of
        rebirth. Often actual history has little say in where the battle-lines form:
        politics unanimously condemned by the Empire might be defended by invoking that
        very name, while ethics cherished then are being reintroduced as a new thing,
        with the Moon embroidered on the battle flag.
      %p Let me introduce the players, or at least set the stage:

      %p
        A couple of words on this whole Skyfire thing and the Near in general; why is
        this historical back-story material useful in practice?
      %p
        Most campaigns do not concern themselves directly with the Year of Shadow or
        the Skyfire, or in fact any old myths I might choose to include between these
        covers. Your typical campaign tells the stories of individual people who
        sometimes rise to change their own society into something better. For most
        purposes you can just file this Skyfire thing in the bottom drawer and
        concentrate on the now: these fictional people in this fictional situation.
      %p
        Regardless, the Skyfire and the coming of the Moon are a common strand that
        ties together the stories of Near. The world is young and raw after the
        catastrophe, but the shadow of the past presses down on it; there’s lots of
        high-level thematic stuff in heroes who rebuild the world and need to choose
        between the past and the unknown future. The Story Guide or anybody interested
        in setting backstory can use this stuff to make sense of things for himself.
      %p
        One thing I like to play with here is the symbolism of what the actions of
        player characters actually mean for the world: just like the characters are
        struggling to find their place in society, so is the world itself trying to
        find an equilibrium. It’s completely arbitrary, but I like to think that should
        the heroes fail in their own passion (whatever it may be), perhaps that doesn’t
        bode well for the whole world, either: as the days get longer and the Moon
        grows larger, this failed world goes into tidal lock and dies out of the last
        convulsion it was given by cruel fate.
      %p
        Then again, heroic deeds go with the genre, so great successes are also
        narrated. The astronomy of Near is in shambles after the Moon appeared, the
        celestial objects themselves are still adjusting. Whenever a hero transcends
        (TRANSCENDENT success in an Ability check, you know) in Near, an eclipse
        blackens the sky for an hour, day or night. Perhaps it is a sign of hope for
        the people.

    %p
      Across the deep waters of Absolon's Way lie the ruins of Maldor, once the
      grandest empire Near has ever known. Before the Shadow Moon came, Maldor ruled
      the world, its empire spreading from the Eastern Sea to the frozen waters of
      the South and the Hungry River of the north. Maldor's most distinctive feature
      was its tremendous walled cities, giant sealed engines of industry and culture.
      As the empire fell and shrunk back to the center of Near, many of its cities
      were ruined as terror and plague eradicated their denizens. These cities,
      filled with secrets and danger, are a destination for especially foolish or
      brave adventurers.
    %p
      Today the land is much different; the old ways of the Empire have given way to
      brazen robber barons and failed principalities that can just barely protect
      their Lords, leaving the peasantry and negligible citizenry to fight for the
      scraps.
    %p
      Maldor is made up of a variety of geography, from rolling plains stretching to
      the ocean in the east to forest-covered hills in the west. It once was
      beautiful. It now looks like someone dropped a bomb on the cover of a
      sad-eyed-wizard fantasy novel.

        When the Sky Fire fell, Emperor Absolon passed on and Maldor passed into
        darkness. As people took to the land again, the country found itself shattered,
        with local lords claiming royal blood dividing the land up like lions on a
        carcass: unfair and bloody. The disparity between the wealthy and poor is
        immense; only those families with great stone fortresses and great stores were
        able to emerge as anything but destitute.
      %p
        The Lords of the land press commoners into service as infantry, farmers,
        artisans, or whatever suits their whims. Outright war between these Lords is
        not uncommon as they attempt to gain dominance over each other. None have
        achieved their goal, however, and the country remains divided.
      %p
        The Maldorites are war-weary, blindly attempting to follow their old ways of
        life. The people are a mix of ethnicities, although the noble lines are all
        Caucasoid in appearance. Nobility treasures their blood and the peasants huddle
        together, but families are often separated by war, hunger, and wanderlust.
        Filthy children run rampant; with nothing to own, people make much of their

        %a#the-remnants-of-culture{:name => "the-remnants-of-culture"} The Remnants of Culture
      %p
        Maldor is in its dark ages; the old Civil Service wilted soon after the
        academies closed down, with the remaining officials turning their talents of
        lore and wizardry to the service of the Lords in an effort of survival,
        becoming courtiers. The noble courts are now the primary centers of learning in
        Maldor. Sciences, history and the arts of wizardry are transmitted by masters
        to their disciples individually, as they will and care.
      %p
        Art and culture take second-place to survival. Among the noble classes, art
        still exists in collections from before the Shadow Moon came. Tapestries,
        painting, and sculpture are most prized. Artists are employed by lords, but
        innovation is rare: the artists are called on to make knock-offs of preShadow
        art more than anything else. Musicians and actors do well if they can find a
        liege, as owning the better court entertainment is a major point of pride for
        these cardboard nobles playing at being kings.
      %p
        Other troubadours wander the countryside, going from inn to inn to make a few
        pieces of gold. It is said that one enterprising merchant hired a gang of
        mercenaries to pillage a fallen city and is now printing books using a press
        they managed to liberate. From the borderlands, there are stories of commoners
        banding together to rebuild villages; these communes are said to sponsor
        community theatres of dubious quality, but high humor.
      %p
        The food of Maldor is considered bland by the rest of the world, but it is
        hearty and filling. Potatoes are served at every meal, from a commoner's feast
        to a noble's snack. On the other hand, Maldor's beer is the best in the world.

        The Maldorian economy can be described as an ever hungry violent monster,
        constantly devouring itself to live. Farmers grow grain, corn, potatoes, and
        other root vegetables and raise goats, sheep, and cattle for milk and food, but
        it never seems to be enough, especially as the Lords take an obscene amount of
        crops and livestock in land taxes to pay for their wars. Beer and vodka make up
        a large amount of their exports, especially to the Gorenite highlands. Metal is
        found in the western hills, and what doesn't become an axe or breastplate gets
        sold to the iron-poor north. Most families have to supplement their income by
        taking up the sword. The nobles promise good pay in their armies, although
        plenty of young people end up dying on the end of a sword before payday.
      %p
        Individual lords of Maldor supplement their coffers by trading priceless
        artifacts and antiquities to foreigners. The Ammenite Houses are the major
        buyers of these objects. There is good pay in Maldor for a seasoned explorer;
        the ruins of many great cities are filled with arms and art, as well as fierce
        ratkin unlikely to appreciate pillagers.

        Maldor is the linchpin of TSoY in that it holds the Shadow of Yesterday: the
        past is everywhere in sight and its weight oppresses the land every day. A game
        set in Maldor will not necessarily go all revolutionary, however; characters
        may well end up championing the feudal obligations, transforming the shallow
        rule of warlords into a real social contract between the rulers and the ruled.
        I try to reflect this in the crunch, which provides some
        functional-but-not-quite means for upholding a society in an essentially
        lawless, feudal context.
      %p
        Maldor also has a function as the point of relation between the fantasy genre
        and Near; this is why I start the book with it. Basically Maldor is your normal
        fantasy setting, so if you want to play around with thieves’ guilds and such,
        this is the place. There are only few fantasy staples that can’t be inserted
        here at the group’s pleasure, and ADVENTURE CAMPAIGNS are more than natural,
        whether they only start or remain indefinitely in Maldor.

        %p
          Maldorian society is traditionally chauvinistic, which means more for the upper
          classes and less for the lower. It’s become pretty typical in fantasy
          roleplaying through recent years to actively ignore this facet of medievalism
          in favor of gender transparency, which is something you can easily do here as
          well for player characters (or everybody) if you want; however, I suggest
          considering the opposite tack as well: if you want to play a woman of Maldor,
          is it not an important part of her identity that she has to deal with these
          issues in her life?
        %p
          My own first instinct would be to simply play a male character if I wanted to
          avoid dealing with this (admittedly well-worn, at least here in my own play
          environment) issue. Another important point is that at least in my experience
          bad play around gender has often resulted from disabling play as opposed to
          enabling; the Story Guide shouldn’t simply use gender as a sadistic hammer for
          harassing some players.
        %p
          In practice: if you are Story Guiding for female characters and feel like
          forbidding the character from leaving her home or speaking in public, consider
          the situation as a genuine choice for the player, not a prerequisite for play;
          should they choose to have her rebel, respect the character’s right to try to
          change her circumstances or even the world.

        The diminishing middle class of imperial Maldor is represented today by
        courtiers and craftsmen. When the common people are concerned only with
        survival and the Lords only with war, the cultural heritage of the land and the
        world is in their hands.
      %p
        Freedom is at a premium in the lawless Maldor. Even the nobility is constrained
        in their lives by the expectations of their peers and vassals, and by the
        necessities of war. The game is played for the highest stakes of all, but it is
        far from certain whether participating in it is worth the sacrifice, morally
        right or even humane. Getting out might cost even more, however, because your
        family is just as committed as you are.
      %p
        Maldorian peasants as player characters seem to usually be either vagrants,
        rebels or not peasants for long; the social framework of Maldor is such that it
        doesn’t make for much of a drama to accept this lot in life. If the player
        character doesn’t want to leave and doesn’t want to change the system, the
        Story Guide does well to proffer him a chance at social betterment through the
        court or battlefield.
      %p
        Rebellions discontent with the rule of particular Lords mingle freely with
        proper revolutions that strive to start new societies afresh. Reformation
        towards the society of the old Empire is far from unknown as well in the
        central areas that still remember. I don’t hesitate to mix modernistic, utopian
        and high philosophical ideas into the social movements that roll through the
        Maldorian countryside. There is no one revolution, but many.

      The people of Near were traumatized and broken by the Skyfire. The original
      Empire of Maldor was defined by solar worship, reaching its height in the image
      of Absolon Sun-Emperor, the champion of Sun in Near, worthy of worship in
      himself. When the Moon rose for the first time and eclipsed the Sun, it became
      an object of veneration and fear in one stroke.

      %p
        The lords of Maldor are monotheistic. Their religion centers around a variation
        of ancient sun god worship: they have melded the figure of the sun god and
        Absolon, saying that the Year of Shadow was Absolon's sacrifice as he descended
        into the underworld, then rose again, undefeated by Shadow. Their priests
        prophesy his return to Near as a king that will re-unite Maldor and make it
        strong again. Some philosophers might debate about when Absolon will come
        again, but the lords do not: there's not a one of them without the hubris to
        think that he is Absolon-Come-again, and that all will bow down to him. This
        messiah complex makes their wars all the more bloody, of course.
      %p
        The original empire of Maldor was defined by its worship of the sun as deity.
        The sun gave light and life to all things and was venerated as such. The
        original worship was personal and communal in nature; small invocations were
        given before a meal, for example. As the empire grew, worship was formalized
        and gave birth to a priestly class. The Emperor Absolon was designated the
        sun's champion on Near, and became an object of worship himself. The trappings
        of sun worship can still be found in Maldor, including broken churches, usually
        designed with no roof and a structure that was aligned with sunrise and sunset.
      %p
        Monotheism trickles down to the peasants, who tend to worship the sun god in
        its more pagan aspect, as a giver of life and blessing. Unlike the lords, the
        peasants definitely argue about when Absolon will return: their dream of a
        better day is well-deserved, but pathetic. As Maldor was once a great
        multicultural cornucopia, though, religion varies widely among its lower
        classes, which practice animism, ancestor worship, or any variety of other
        religious practices in addition to sun-worship.

          sun. Charles of the Zenith and Philippe the Dawn-Breaker are two examples.
          State worship is often enforced by blade and taxes are taken directly from the
          collections of these new churches. Their priests are as much political and

        Rumors of a Shadow Cult abound, evildoers who would try to throw down the sun
        and replace it with their dark Queen of Shadow. It is unknown who exactly the
        Shadow Cult is. Earls and dukes tell their people that the Shadow Cult are the
        followers of other earls and dukes; advisors tell their lords that the Shadow
        Cult grows among their own people; commoners believe the Shadow Cult are the
        ratkin, or nasty elves, or their next-door neighbors, depending on what day of
        the week it is. Some elements have been assassinating self-proclaimed messiahs
        and blowing up castle walls without getting caught, but leave no clue as to
        whom they are.
      %p
        The reality of the Shadow Cult is that it has no leaders and it revels in
        plurality. Whether this anarchy turns into discord as the Sun Lords weaken
        remains to be seen – for now there is well enough room for witches, ratkin,
        revolutionaries, reformers and even republicans in the ranks of the movement.
        The theology of the Shadow Cult is vague, but generally it deals with ending
        the rule of man, celebrating the human body and justifying acts of violence
        against the Sun Lords. The cult practices witchcraft, but not everybody agrees
        that the Queen of Shadow is actually the tri-partite Goddess of old.
        Regardless, the Queen responds to her witches who raise the Aspect of the Moon.
      %p
        Women join the cult for protection and power. Ratkin join the Cult because it
        teaches that the fanged ones are children of the new Goddess. Men join the cult
        for the free sex. Lords join for the poisonous gifts offered against their
        enemies. The cult ceremonies accept all, although some new recruits might find
        themselves under the knives of the less compassionate priestesses of the Moon.

        The last era of the Empire was a time of great breakthroughs. It was then that
        the eye of man was cast at the heavens. The royal astronomers with their
        telescopes discovered new stars that moved like no other. With time their
        secret was deciphered: like the Emperor was orbited by servants in running the
        empire, so was the Sun Lord himself orbited by these eight planets, Servitors
        of the Sun. What transformed the understanding of the sages, however, was this:
        Near was one of these Servitors.
      %p
        Now much of this knowledge is lost, but legends still remember the names of the
        Servitors:

        %li ENCHIRIDION, Mysterious Confidant
        %li FAR, Trusted Stranger
      %p
        The litany of names is revered by courtiers, what remains of the Civil Service
        of Antiquity. The Servitors are a resonant idea, suggesting a celestial order
        that refutes stark monotheism. They get no worship, however, for they are only
        remembered by men too civilized for gods. Even where the commoners know the
        stories, they cannot see the stars: the sky has grown more opaque after the
        Year of Darkness, with only the light of the most powerful stars shining
        through.
      %p
        Still, in a time of chaos, many courtiers rely on the litany for their dignity
        and role in the drab, martial courts of the present Lords. It is not a faith on
        the unseen gods so much as a faith on the tradition and propriety that allows
        the courtier courage to rise even against his Lord at times to demand and
        receive the proper respect. Thus the Servitors shape the life of those who care
        of their example; every court magician knows the banes set on their work, every
        reeve that they have no jurisdiction over the servants of the legal counsel.

        There is huge thematic tension in the sun cult of Absolon as it relates to
        character identity, being how it is just about the only religious tradition in
        the book that doesn’t offer kewl powerz up the wazoo. I find it interesting to
        play the humble rural sun priest as a good guy, or have the influential abbot
        do his best against the ravages of a corrupt Lord, all without Solar Rays of
        Death in his back pocket.
      %p
        The Shadow Cult is the only serious ideology to resist the Lords of Maldor, but
        at least in my games it seems to be filled with terrorist assholes willing to
        go to any lengths against the Lords. This is sad, as the Shadow Cult is also
        the only really liberal theology in Maldor. Traditional witchcraft is weak in
        Maldor, but it makes for interesting sectarian disputes when it encounters its
        young, mad sibling faith.

        The Servitors are only a faint idea, wistful for a third way but impotent in

          %a#no-gods{:name => "no-gods"} No Gods
        %p
          This is just the first of many chapters in the book to include explicit
          religions that even have magic powers. What does it mean, exactly, that Near
          “does not include gods”?
        %p
          The answer is simple: the Story Guide never considers celestial intent in the
          plays he makes, nothing ever happens on the initiative of gods, and gods never
          communicate, and especially never, ever take any stand on issues, even if their
          purported representatives do. As far as the Story Guide is concerned, he’s
          running a materialistic setting where having faith gives you super-powers,
          whatever the characters might think. This doesn’t even particularly mean that
          the characters are objectively wrong in their beliefs; it just means that even
          if they are right, that’s not part of the game, and their beliefs will never be
          affirmed by the setting authority, even if the story itself should.
        %p
          There are plenty of things the players can do with gods, even with the Story
          Guide thus constrained. Roll a PRAY (V) check, have your character go into
          stupor and afterwards claim to have spoken with the Sun Lord who told him that
          he’s actually Absolon Reborn? Sure, as long as it’s clear that we’re just
          talking about your character’s subjective experience. That sort of thing is
          completely in the player’s purview, the Story Guide can never claim that nuhuh,
          the Sun Lord didn’t talk to your character, because the Sun Lord wouldn’t – he
          doesn’t have that power, because the gods are not his to play.
        %p
          If the reader is wondering why we hash these nuances, the short answer is that
          this anti-god agenda is just another part of the humanistic strategy in TSoY,
          and a sort of safety rail against bad fantasy game habits: the Story Guide
          cannot have gods steal the story from the player characters when gods are not
          in his toolbox. Whatever choices characters make, whatever the consequences,
          the events play out without divine interventions, at least ones not backed
          mechanically by characters actually present in the story.

      Militarily focused campaigns are an obvious choice in Maldor, the land wracked

      with making the right strategic choices – just like always, the choices we want
      to engender are over how much the characters are willing to risk and to what
      gain.  Right and wrong warcraft is judged on that basis.

        Most lords of Maldor maintain almost permanent armies, the bulk of which is
        formed of MILITIAS and GUARDS of infantry. The difference between the two is in
        whether the troop was formed by conscription or voluntarily. The military
        paradigm emphasizes disciplined troop action; foot soldiers are not expected to
        have initiative, but rather to use pre-learned maneuvers to move and fight in
        coordination. Militia sergeants are the best of the veterans, while guard
        sergeants are almost always mercenaries from the border marches where ancient
        tradition and terrain make the footman into the core of the army.
      %p
        Cavalry has the pride of place in modern Maldorian warcraft, foremost because
        cavalrymen are professional soldiers with superior morale. The ones that own
        their own horses and weapons are called KNIGHTS, while the rest are ARMSMEN and
        receive their arms from their liege. Cavalry sergeants are valued veteran
        armsmen or knights.
      %p
        The captains of all Maldorian military units are theoretically of noble blood,
        although foot units are considered much less prestigious and in practice often
        end up in the command of trusted veterans. There is not much formal careerism
        in the military of today; the land is much too chaotic and the armed forces of
        individual Lords in constant transition. The best a captain can do is to make
        himself and his unit gain in value in the eyes of the Lord – that is, if he
        doesn’t decide to lead his loyal troop out east to Ammeni, where mercenaries
        are paid well and respected highly for their superior fighting skills.

        Roleplayers usually have plenty of experience in running normal skirmish
        combats, so I won’t worry my head about those. Some other situations might
        require advice, however:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Warbands:
        %dd
          When a character has a vague number of extras backing him in combat, he has a
          WARBAND. This by itself does nothing, but it allows the character to try
          leading from the back (rolling BATTLE (R) as primary) or boosting his personal
          combat prowess with tactics (rolling BATTLE (R) in support) or train his troops
          (creating various Effects with BATTLE (R)). Basically it’s the Story Guide who
          decides whether a bunch of extras forms a warband; I’d let anything with armed
          adult men or equivalent willing to fight pass, as long as there’s more than a
          couple of them.
        %dt One against many:
        %dd
          When an individual character fights against a bunch of extras without
          leadership, promote one of the extras into a real secondary character. Give
          them a real motivation, too, not just “I want to kill the player character.”
        %dt Being underdog:
        %dd
          When a hero fights against another who has extras supporting him, assign
          circumstance penalties to the underdog. If both have support, don’t bother
          unless the difference in numbers or quality is cinematic – just like always
          with circumstance penalties.
        %dt Holding the line:
        %dd
          If a player character is not in command of a battle, he doesn’t have leverage
          to determine the outcome of the battle outright. The Story Guide decides the
          outcome in these situations, just like with any conflicts between secondary
          characters. A non-combatant player character or one fighting in the battle
          might still influence the outcome with partial stakes (see below).
        %dt Partial stakes:
        %dd
          This is important. When a character has insufficient leverage in any conflict
          to get his way, the Story Guide is responsible for downgrading the scope of the
          conflict stakes to match the character’s capabilities. In battle this is
          commonly seen when a player character is just one of the troops fighting; he
          may well run conflicts about whether he gets injured or captured himself, or to
          save the lives of others or to do other heroic things on the battlefield, but
          he can’t determine the outcome of the whole battle unless a suitable
          opportunity presents him with such leverage.
      %p
        As can be seen, battles with many participants work exactly like normal
        skirmishes as far as the mechanics are concerned. The characters that actually
        have dramatic goals in the situation get the spotlight, and this may or may not
        mean that a player character gets an opportunity to influence the battle
        outside his immediate vicinity.

        I’ll return to those partial stakes for a bit, because they are important when
        the whole campaign starts revolving around what characters can and can’t
        accomplish in battle. Specifically, how does superior LEVERAGE affect the
        stakes of a battle? This is how:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          There are so many enemies that the sparse defenders can only hope to delay,
          not to stop them. While the character’s GOAL might be to stop the enemy, the
          Story Guide downgrades the STAKES into “delay them long enough for a
          successful retreat”.
        %li
          The lone hero never even stops to consider fighting the enemy, they are so
          many. He can’t hope for stakes like “I win the battle”, alone as he is, so he
          accepts “I escape from their hands”.
      %p
        There are other ways of building asymmetric, biased stakes, but the basic
        principle is the same: when a character doesn’t have appropriate leverage to
        fight the forces arrayed against him properly, he has no choice but to accept
        lesser stakes. This is really obvious from a cinematic viewpoint; nobody ever
        questions it when the hero runs from superior forces. Still, sometimes
        roleplayers stare a bit too intently at the dicing rules of a game and start
        claiming that they have some sort of right to a “fair fight” against any
        comers.
      %p
        Now, in actual play the technique of partial stakes depends a lot on the Story
        Guide. A given campaign might be so superheroic that partial stakes would never
        come up: heroic swordsmen just up and face whole armies arranged against them,
        and win. However, I like my TSoY with a tad grimmer take, which is why I have
        crunch that actually formalizes the Story Guide judgment here: the key piece of
        rules material in this chapter is the SOLDIER IMBUEMENT, which says this same
        thing: a character with a professional Maldorian MILITARY UNIT backing him is
        actually unassailable on the open field by a single hero, barring magic or
        whatnot.
      %p
        MILITARY UNITS with the SOLDIER IMBUEMENT have SUPERIOR LEVERAGE in martial
        conflict, which means that lone heroes automatically lose against them if they
        try to clash directly. This is heavy stuff in the SOLAR SYSTEM context, so it’s
        definitely up to you whether you want to allow this option in your own
        campaign. If you do, remember that “auto-lose” only means that characters can’t
        contest the military unit directly on the field; they can still conflict over
        weaker stakes such as escaping, delaying, misdirecting and so on.
      %p
        Also, the basic strategy for a lesser force (and the one I’m shooting for here;
        it’s what they do in this sort of fiction) is to attack the unit cohesion of
        the military unit: units in disorder are useless as equipment. The character
        leading a military unit often has to choose between protecting the cohesion of
        his unit (by avoiding melee, for example) and actually doing anything in the
        battle. And of course characters can just choose other means apart from
        violence; a military unit is just as vulnerable to a convincing speech or
        major-scale magic as any other warband.

            conflicts, although it is not at its best in unarmed situations, ambushes,
            darkness or other exceptional conditions.
          %dt Cavalry (V)

            Cavalry soldiers learn to maneuver and fight on horseback. This Ability can be
            used to ride well and for cavalry maneuvers on the battlefield, such as
            charges. A horseman stuck in close quarters still uses MELEE (V) to resolve
            those situations, however. Consequently Maldorian cavalry soldiers are
            generally expected to synergize their MELEE (V) and Cavalry Abilities.
          %dt Battle (R)
          %dd
            The Ability to plan and lead battles to achieve strategic objectives. A
            character needs a warband or more to execute such a plan, and Battle won’t
            protect his own person if he is attacked. Sometimes Battle can be used to win a
            war without conflict, should the opponent lack a similar Ability and thus be
            unable to prevent a defeat in detail.
          %dt Logistics (R)
          %dd
            The Ability concerns knowledge of the best practices of accounting and
            organizing major projects, such as supplying a military force on the move. It
            is useful for organizing large undertakings in civil engineering as well,

            army out of several military units and warbands as an Effect. An opponent
            wanting to disrupt the army’s chain of command has to attack this Effect to do
            so. An army has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE against individual warbands when it comes to

            (ENGINEERING), or a character might come to possess one by other means. Either
            way, the castle imbuement provides SUPERIOR LEVERAGE to a suitable defensive
            force against enemy warbands, making it impossible for the opponent to attack
            the defenders directly. Even if the enemy has the means to try storming the
            castle, they will suffer penalty dice to any Ability checks to do so equal to

            The character is familiar with classical siege warfare and may thus direct
            circumvallation, sapping, building and moving siege machines and so on. A siege
            conducted with these strategies may directly attack the Effect value of
            opposing fortifications with ENGINEERING (R) checks. The character’s war

            work to stabilize him by activating this Secret. This prevents the character
            from bleeding to death and prepares him for long-term care with real medicinal

            level of success on a BATTLE (R) check. Appropriate questions could involve
            ranking the character’s Pools against each other or against other characters,
            finding out the exact current value of a single Pool, finding out the
            character’s highest Ability and its level, recognizing a Secret the character

            In practice this means that the player gets to choose the Abilities used by
            both sides of the conflict, as he describes the exact moment of conflict
            resolution in the fiction. Cost: 1 REASON for non-martial conflicts, or REASON

        Running combat for the sake of combat is not very interesting, so I don’t
        particularly recommend using this war material just because it’s there. Some
        players might gravitate towards power-tripping with the mechanically cheap
        power provided here, which is of course fine, but not the actual point; the
        Story Guide should know where to go from there, as simply running combat after
        combat doesn’t do much in this game.
      %p
        I’m myself pretty fond of military science fiction after having had too much
        time in my hands earlier this decade and reading a bit too many paperback books
        by Lois McMaster Bujold, David Feintuch, David Weber and such. This literary
        genre has been on my mind a lot when playing TSoY in Maldor, as the military
        themes are similar: honor between fighting men, responsibility for the welfare
        of the men and the cause they fight for, obedience and contempt towards
        civilian authorities... Maldor is a great place for war stories of adventurous
        bend.
      %p
        A key issue here is that soldier characters need to be challenged morally just
        the same as everybody else. If their war happens to be just, then there might
        be division in the ranks or corrupt officers; if the troop thinks with one
        mind, perhaps the resources might not be enough to achieve all goals,
        necessitating gruesome triage; if everything can be achieved, perhaps the
        consequences of victory are where the actual issue resides; if all else is
        well, perhaps the problem is with the mind or family of the soldier himself? It
        is not acceptable to reduce military fiction into a straightforward calculus of
        won and lost battles.
      %p
        I’ll write more on this issue in the Chapter 12 wherein I consider the worst
        war Near knows today. Surprisingly enough, Lords of Maldor are not behind those
        atrocities. Not directly.

    %p
      %em Crunch adapted from Clinton’s book with original additions, some original fluff.
    %p
      When Maldor reigned supreme, a great magical working was attempted by wizards
      of utmost skill. Magical sight was utilized to reveal the underlying structure
      of the world. This new mysticism that partook of other magics of the age was
      called Three-Corner, for it unified mind to body with spirit.
    %p
      Emperor Absolon sponsored a great academy of magic for the research and
      teaching of this superior art. A great three-cornered fortress was erected in a
      secret place on the western hills to house the Three-Corner Academy. Cultural
      Inspection units were sent to trawl the world for secrets.
    %p
      At its zenith the Three-Corner Academy taught a clarified magical philosophy
      based on the dual triangles of Night and Day. Many highest officers of the
      court were drawn from the Academy, and ThreeCorner magic spread to far reaches
      of Near.
    %p
      Today the Academy is lost, but the magic itself survives in the courts of
      Maldor. Knowledge of the Three-Corner arts is feared and respected among the
      commoners and foreign peoples who know little difference between hucksters,
      witches and magical philosophers. Many wizards have taken to the roads in the
      hope of improving their lot in various ways.

        Students of the Three-Corner way learn magical FOCI, methods for unlocking the
        mind and seeing the world-that-is. There are six foci divided into two
        triangles, the Day and the Night. Like so:

        Of the two triangles the Day triangle was considered the more benign in the
        Academy, and the Night triangle was only taught to Day adepts who could handle
        the responsibility. Now, with the school scattered and third-generation
        knowledge being passed around, much of the structure has been lost. The Night
        foci are today the more common arts, even as they are considered evil magic (as
        opposed to just dangerous) in a manner that was unknown in the past.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#the-focus-abilities{:name => "the-focus-abilities"} The Focus Abilities
        %p
          Each of the Three-Corner foci is an Ability that is learned separately. They
          hardly come naturally to humans, so a player can only write a focus on the
          character sheet if the character has had schooling in the art. This is
          surprisingly common in Maldor among all social classes, as many arcanists were
          reduced into village wise men after the Year of Shadow. Elsewhere it’s mostly
          learned sages who know of the foci, as well as the occasional traveler.
        %p
          As a rule of thumb, if the players decide to give a character access to
          Three-Corner based on his background, he would usually know one or both of the
          triangles, not just one or two Abilities at random – understanding comes at
          once for each triangle.

            %dt Creation (V)
            %dd
              CREATION is to bring matter into being. The character can create a small amount
              – a handful or so – of a basic element (fire, earth, water, air) out of
              nothing.
            %dt Destruction (V)
            %dd
              DESTRUCTION is to make matter disperse. The character can erode materials he
              touches. How this looks like depends on the player, but it is obviously
              supernatural.
            %dt Enhancement (I)
            %dd
              ENHANCEMENT is to make things more like themselves, increasing order. The
              character can improve and strengthen items and people. The Ability can be used
              to support most anything else, but does not do anything by itself.
            %dt Transformation (I)
            %dd
              TRANSFORMATION is to change things into something else, decreasing order. The
              character can force naturally pliable things to take on a new shape without
              tools or containers.
            %dt Divination (R)
            %dd
              DIVINATION is to reveal purpose. The character can sense magical auras in
              things and people, as well as see invisible things and the disposition of
              animals and people.
            %dt Enthrallment (R)
            %dd
              ENTHRALLMENT is to control purpose. The character can force another being to
              bend to his will. The target is well aware of the magical compulsion.

      %p
        The Three-Corner foci are normal Abilities in most respects. As pure Abilities
        they are pretty limited, however, and more powerful magical workings often
        require the wizard to combine magical Secrets in their workings. Furthermore,
        all Three-Corner magic has certain rules and limitations that hold true unless
        lifted somehow:
      .section
        %h4

          %li Only one target may be affected by one working.
          %li
            A magical effect is either instantaneous or lasts one hour; in the latter
            case the player has to make the working into an Effect to uphold the magic
            for longer than the one scene.
          %li All Three-Corner magic may be resisted by the target with RESIST (R).
      .section
        %h4
          %a#complex-magical-effects{:name => "complex-magical-effects"} Complex magical effects
        %p
          In actual play a magical working is often created by combining the powers of
          several foci and Secrets that modify their limitations. For example, a wizard
          who wanted to use any of the foci at distance would need to modify the basic
          function with the SECRET OF MAGICAL HAND.
        %p
          When a wizard makes a working that requires the use of several foci, the focus
          Abilities are tested normally as a support chain, starting with the best
          Ability. All checks need to succeed for a working to be successful.
        %p
          Complex Three-Corner magic usually requires the character to spend Pool points
          to power the magic. Discretionary costs are assigned by the player to any Pool
          associated with the foci used by the working.
        %p
          In play we often need to figure out which foci and Secrets a character needs to
          activate to achieve a certain magical effect. The sensibilities of the group,
          often expressed by the Story Guide, are a fine guide in this. The example
          spells later on will provide a fine guide to the degree of fanciful freedom
          we’ve found optimal for fun play.

          %a#spells{:name => "spells"} Spells
        %p
          A wizard who wants to reuse the same magical working again and again will do
          well to consider creating a SPELL of it. Spells are cheaper and quicker to cast
          than free workings, but less flexible as well. For example, a wizard could make
          a working that dropped a big rock on his enemy; this would require the CREATION
          (V) focus, SECRET OF INVISIBLE HAND and the SECRET OF CREATE VOLUME. As a spell
          it would look like this:
        %blockquote
          %dl.docutils
            %dt Spell of Rockfall
            %dd
              The caster points at a spot and a large rock drops on it from nowhere. The
              rock disappears after an hour. Requires a CREATION (V) check. Cost: CREATE
              VOLUME: 3 VIGOR MAGICAL HAND: 1 VIGOR Total: 3+1-1= 3 VIGOR
        %p
          As can be seen, a spell gains the wizard a one Pool discount in casting cost.
          However, it is less flexible: the caster cannot choose the size of the rock,
          drop something other than a rock or otherwise modify the working when casting
          it as a spell.
        %p
          Spells cost an Advance to learn, just like Secrets. A character can further
          improve the spell’s cost by spending several Advances on it, even making the
          spell free. In traditional academy magic the cost of a spell after discounts
          and assigning discretionary costs turns out as balanced as possible between the
          involved Pools.
        %p
          Another benefit of spells is that, depending on the group’s aesthetics, they
          might be simpler and quicker to cast than freeform magical workings. In my
          games, for example, a spell is much more feasible than any other working in
          time-constraint situations, as the wizard has practiced this particular working
          many times before.
        %p
          A final benefit of a spell is that a character can learn one even if he doesn’t
          know the different Secrets that were used in creating it. This is useful for
          Three-Corner dabblers or characters that want to specialize.
      .section

        %p
          Three-Corner is supposed to be one of the most flexible and comprehensive
          magical theories in Near – to a degree of arrogance, in fact. Thus we might
          well presume that the Three-Corner Secrets depicted here are only a small part
          of the whole magical tradition. The group should definitely create new Secrets
          to give Three-Corner magicians the tools to do almost anything they want.
          Magicians can research new solutions, too, arduous as that might be.
        %p
          This is not to say that all feats of magic should be equally easy. Perhaps
          there are some blind spots to the comprehensively bland, scientific approach
          Three-Corner takes to magic. The Story Guide is unlikely to allow improvisation
          with a system this regimented. There is no poetic mystery to Three-Corner –
          whether this is a flaw could be a major theme in play.

        The Three-Corner Academy was never as influential on the religious and
        otherworldly life of Maldor as when it came to an end, scattering the masters
        and students alike all over the world. Now every court of any note boasts a
        court magician of supposedly vast power and knowledge; every village has a
        physician or craftsman with some small shard of the thrice-wound philosophy.
        Even outside Maldor proper it is rare to encounter a sage who’d fail to list
        the dual triangles.
      %p
        Academy magic was atheistic, mystical and alchemical, convinced of its
        universal character and superiority of the message, which was nevertheless
        considered too elevated and complex for the common man. In their own mind
        academy tricornerists formed a secret elite of the Empire, one that was
        spiritually ascendant simply by the virtue of their practice. It was said that
        Three-Corner philosophy was the true secret, with the magic an afterthought.
      %p
        Today the understanding of the thought behind the magic is considerably less
        certain and unified; two practitioners of the magic do not necessarily see eye
        to eye on even what the dual balance achieved by the Three-Corner practitioner
        is supposed to mean. Many tricornerists are members of the Celestial cults,
        unsatisfied or unknowing of the cosmology behind their own practice. When the
        magic is practiced by little more than hucksters and hedge magicians, it is no
        wonder if they mix in RITUAL MAGIC (R) practices and other ideas; everybody
        swears that theirs is the pure lineage of the Lost Academy, but sometimes their
        ideas are total opposites of each other. Maldor is a xenophobic, traumatized
        land. When rumors of the Shadow Cult rise, a wandering Three-Corner wizard may
        find himself being burnt as a witch. It is a horrible death.

              The character can create “energy”, a massless, semi-opaque substance that
              releases light when disturbed. Energy does not occur in pure form naturally and
              cannot be mistaken for any natural substance. It is considered the ideal matter

              The user of an item made of Energy can pay VIGOR to reduce any harm to the
              item on a 1:1 basis, forcing it to keep its form against attempts at breaking
              it. The light (or heat, when adjusted) released by Energy on impact causes any
              opponent in violent conflict to suffer a penalty die to their checks. Remember

            %dd
              Normally Three-Corner Creation does not work to overlay substantial
              resistances, only to gently displace them. This Secret allows the character’s
              creation to share the space with other matter. Depending on the nature and
              shape of the creation, this might result in impalement, explosive displacement
              or instant and uniform mixtures of matter. Cost: 1+ the target’s RESIST (R)
              check in VIGOR.

      %p
        The Story Guide should remember that Three-Corner magic still benefits and is
        limited by all the normal rules that concern all Abilities and Secrets. For
        example, the following points have sometimes proven elusive:

          %a#resisting-three-corner{:name => "resisting-three-corner"} Resisting Three-Corner
        %p
          When magic is used indirectly against a target, such as by destroying the floor
          below him or dropping something heavy on him, he is still allowed to resist the
          outcome (and resulting Harm) normally, provided that he has any leverage at
          all. Casting the magic takes time and it is not always overwhelming, so a
          simple REACT (I) check to jump out of the way or even ENDURE (V) to withstand
          the magic’s effects is quite appropriate. Giving the wizard a gut full of steel
          before he finishes the spell also works.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#imaginary-detail{:name => "imaginary-detail"} Imaginary detail
        %p
          Speaking of finishing spells, different groups imagine the practical craft of
          Three-Corner in different ways. The text is intentionally vague. My imagination
          often involves chanting, gestures and magical ingredients that are mostly
          glossed over as mechanical issues. Still, I’ve been known to issue penalty dice
          or deny usage of Three-Corner due to leverage issues when a character would
          have had to whip some exotic and unlikely magic up in an eye blink. My rule of
          thumb is that a one-focus spell takes a couple of seconds to set up, but
          anything more complex takes up more time, to a degree where I don’t usually
          allow multi-focus workings (except as spells) in split-second action sequences.
        %p
          The important part is to follow the group’s expectations in this matter. If
          there are none, then explore what the magic feels and tastes like! Ask the
          player to make the calls to find out what your magic looks like.
        %p
          One particular approach is to make the academic paradigms described in Keys
          lift their weight: what the wizard believes and strives for in his magic could
          influence his methods in working the magic, answering these questions.

        %h4
          %a#measuring-magnitudes{:name => "measuring-magnitudes"} Measuring Magnitudes
        %p
          Most SOLAR SYSTEM mechanics eschew fictional measurements. Typically we only
          care of dramatic measure, which is much easier to ascertain without busting out
          the fictional rulers to ascertain distances, volumes and such. Three-Corner
          magic, however, uses plenty of fictional measures, just as one would expect of
          a scientific magical discipline. How does one judge these matters?
        %p
          My own rule of thumb is always that the Story Guide is the final arbiter of
          fictional measurements. When a character tries to block a cave entrance with a
          big magical rock, say, the Story Guide decides according to setting fidelity
          and dramatic coordination whether the entrance is small enough for a third
          magnitude CREATE VOLUME or what. Similarly, when a wizard cloaks himself with
          magical invisibility, it’s the Story Guide who decides when the one-hour
          duration of magic runs out and the spell needs to be recast.

          %a#three-corner-in-conflict{:name => "three-corner-in-conflict"} Three-Corner in Conflict
        %p
          A basic question for any Secrets that cost a lot of Pool to make something
          happen: what if another character conflicts the event and takes it into
          extended conflict? After all, the other character has a right to resist, but it
          also sucks to spend 10 Pool on a spell and have it do nothing.
        %p
          The simple answer is that while the conflict is still on-going, the wizard’s
          spell has not resolved yet: the character can continue casting his spell in
          extended conflict, making appropriate Ability checks or even doing something
          else while the magic percolates (or whatever; it’s magic). The spell will only
          ultimately fail if the character stops casting it in the fiction or he loses
          the conflict (which was over the success of that spell in the first place).
        %p
          If spells are cast during on-going extended conflict, the opponent might have
          to take a Defensive Action to cope with the new situation and change their
          goals to include preventing the spell, but they still get to declare opposition
          against the magic. It depends on the effects of the spell whether this is
          worthwhile for the opponent, of course.

        %p
          Almost any sensible magics a proper wizard would hope for can usually be created just by
          combining one of the focus Abilities and one Secret. For example:
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Burning your foe to ash
          %dd
            would be accomplished with DESTRUCTION (V) + MAGICAL HAND. This would cost
            just one VIGOR point for doing it at a distance. If you had several enemies to
            burn, adding MAGICAL CONTAGION would take care of them all.
          %dt Flying
          %dd
            can be done with smart creation, but I added a GRAVITY Secret specifically
            because I wanted an easy and cheap way of flying about. So Transformation (I) +
            GRAVITY do the trick.
          %dt Charming people
          %dd
            is done with ENTHRALLMENT (R) + GENTLE TOUCH. The latter is important, as most
            don’t take it very well when they are magically controlled.
        %p
          As you can see, most things the wizard wants to do can be done with just one
          Ability and Secret, even if the bulk of the text is concerned with multi-focus
          workings, spells and such. There are fault-lines to this, explored by the
          example spells on the facing page; sometimes a wizard might create a new Secret
          to take care of a weakness, but when he can’t, all sorts of roundabout methods
          are devised by powermad sorcerers.
        %p
          The players should also remember that the rules on what a given working can
          accomplish and what it can’t are basically as flexible as the group wants them
          to be. The example spells can be read with this in mind: the system is followed
          to the letter only where constraint and fine detail work are fun, not where
          they become a chore.

          The Three-Corner wizard would do anything and everything he wants were it not

          for him: these are usually the ones with magnitudes listed in the corresponding
          Secret.
        %p
          There’s not much to be done about how expensive Three-Corner magic is in terms
          of experience and Pool costs. Looking at it from the player’s viewpoint, the
          idea is not that this is a way to amazing power; rather, it’s interesting to
          play with the limitations and self-perception of the wizard, and the
          expectations others place upon him. Often the wizard will find that he is
          trusted to do much greater things than anyone but the Sun Lord himself could
          accomplish.

              A Singing Sword starts to hum when drawn, and may ultimately voice anything
              from horrid battlecries to beautiful ballads, depending on the skills of the
              wielder. It is not sentient, the voices are long-gone echoes of the past,
              cleverly recombined. Ratings: +3 for performing sword-dances +2 for
              demoralizing enemies in battle +1 for musical performances Creation: Each of
              the three ratings is a variation of the idea of a singing sword, so the
              wizard-smith would have spent 2 INSTINCT on his ARTIFICE.

            %dd
              In Antiquity this sort of magic was common: the crystal holds one spell, which

              is FALL TO THE SKY, cast with a REACT (I) check. Imbuements: Mundane Spellcraft
              Fall to the Sky (I) Null-Rating (I) Cost: 1 INSTINCT per scene. 4 INSTINCT to
              cast the spell. Creation: The crystal really has just one magical function, so
              the wizard-smith would spend only 2 INSTINCT on his ARTIFICE.

              invisible. For 2 INSTINCT it flies, spread out, carrying up to three people.
              For 2 VIGOR it protects the wearer from any physical harm. Imbuements: 2 x

      The ratkin are a new thing in Near, unknown to histories of Antiquity. They are
      intelligent like humans, but remain savage and primal like their rodent
      forebears. Ratkin are generally distrusted by humans who consider them filthy
      thieves – neither descriptor is completely misleading.
    %p
      Chaotic collectives of ratkin make their nests in ruins of Maldor, doing their
      best to understand the civilization humans left behind. They can be fiercely
      avaricious, all the more so for the fact that they do not understand ownership;
      as far as the ratkin are concerned, you own only what you can defend. Players
      who choose to play ratkin will do well to read the Beastkin material (chapter
      27). All ratkin take the mandatory SECRET OF RATKIN as their first Secret.

        Ratkin basically look like anthropomorphized rats, complete with tails and
        whiskers. The shared heritage is obvious to both the ratkin themselves and any
        outside observer: ratkin speak gutturally, sometimes run on all fours and in
        general act like overgrown, intelligent rats. About three to four feet tall,
        they have pointed button noses, whiskers, and are covered in either grey,
        brown, or black fur, with the occasional albino all-white ratkin.
      %p
        Perhaps even more striking is the LITTER, the basic social group among ratkin,
        completely instinctual. A given litter consists of three or four ratkin and ten
        to twenty normal rats; the young ratkin are only distinguishable by their
        thumbs and size, being half again as large as their rat kin.
      %p
        The young ratkin learn from an early age to fight vigorously for everything,
        starting with their mother’s teat that the rest of the litter would gladly hog
        if given a chance. The ratkin instinctively know to restrain themselves in
        their constant scrapping, avoiding serious injury. These instincts carry over
        to adulthood: ratkin generally own only what they can carry and do not hesitate
        to fight a bit for whatever they desire.
      %p
        Even without intelligence acting into it, the litter is fiercely loyal to each
        other and quite able to engage in real violence against outside threats. A
        predator attacking a member of the litter is often an offense that is taken
        more seriously than threats against the individual ratkin himself.
      %p
        This social structure remains the same for the HORDE, the larger community the
        litter is born into. The horde might consist of hundreds of ratkin and
        thousands of rats as long as it remains successful as a community.

        Ratkin are most common in Maldor and usually only appear in the environs of the
        old empire. A partial reason for this is that Maldor is a fertile environment
        for the bestial creatures: the ancient walled cities that have long fallen into
        ruin provide an ideal environment for these new beings that thrive among the
        remains of the ancient culture that came before them. This might make such
        places dangerous to other people, as in the ruins the ratkin horde truly is at
        the top of the food chain.
      %p
        Ratkin are social and curious creatures capable of modeling their life on human
        culture. Ownership is something they have a great difficulty understanding,
        however, so it is not uncommon for human societies to ostracize and marginalize
        ratkin, treating individuals as pests, pets, criminals or worse. This is not
        true of all human societies, certainly: the people of Khale accept ratkin as
        natural, and allow them to form tribes that interact with humans on equal
        footing.
      %p
        While most ratkin belong in litter communities that have various relationships
        with humanity, some ratkin end up loners due to ill fate befalling their litter
        or simply because they like the new, civilized lifestyle promised by going
        after humans. Such ratkin prove adaptive, working actively to form bonds with
        any company they meet; a ratkin without a litter is often depressed and moody.

        Wild rumors fly in Maldor of ratkin living in the old cities. Some stories
        elevate albino ratkin above their peers in respect and mysterious powers. It is

        to the same sort of ruin, being a nest of pallid ratkin hostile to humans.
      %p
        Ratkin are considered harbingers of disease by many. One particular disease at
        least is real, although the ratkin himself would probably not know of it: the
        SECRET OF TOXOPLASM is contracted by close relations with ratkin, such as
        drinking from a well they use. Most people of Near would not be equipped to
        even notice the parasite, but it is known that people who associate with ratkin
        sometimes turn... strange. Player characters in danger of contracting the
        toxoplasm might avoid it with an ENDURE (V) check, like any disease.
      %p
        Should a Maldorite human get over his preconceptions and win the trust of a
        horde to his side, there are many things the beings breeding in the body of Old
        Maldor might be able to provide: nobody else knows the old cities as well as
        the ratkin living in them do – ratkin who gather, compulsively sort and even
        worship treasures of a civilization that is at this point starting to be as
        foreign to the modern Maldor as it is to the ratkin themselves.

            Ratkin often carry a few friendly rats with them, perhaps members of their

            rat-type things. They have one Pool-point, or three if the player has named
            individual rats or otherwise focused play on them. The rats usually follow
            instructions, but they scatter immediately under violent attack and only return

            The character can use tools and equipment he found with SCROUNGING (I) instead
            of the proper Ability, but only as long as he hasn’t figured out the proper use
            of the tool. Cost: 1 REASON, cumulative per tool.
          %dt Secret of Resistance
          %dd
            The character is highly resistant to toxins and disease. When succumbing to
            such is at issue, the player may opt to pay VIGOR to turn a failed ENDURE (V)
            check inconclusive; the character has a slight fever and does not develop a
            resistance to the disease, but does not suffer any ill effects, either. Cost:
            VIGOR equal to check difference for opposed checks, 1 VIGOR otherwise.
          %dt Secret of Rat-Stealth
          %dd
            The character has learned to avoid human attention. As long as he stays in
            hiding and does nothing to attract attention, he has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE against
            humans in skulking. Doesn’t work against dogs and other creatures more aware of

            The character can communicate with members of his litter with a successful
            LITTER BOND (I) check (made by both for twoway communication). The
            communication is incomprehensible or even invisible to outsiders, consisting of
            small signals. The player may spend Instinct to allow the character to
            communicate over distance and through obstacles, using a means mysterious to
            non-ratkin. Cost: 1 INSTINCT per obstacle and 3 for a long distance.

            The character can use BOND-SPEECH with other ratkin and rodents aside from his

          %dd
            The character can try to force a target of BOND-SPEECH to act against its will.

          %dt Secret of Toxoplasm
          %dd
            The toxoplasm is a parasite living inside a host brain, most likely a human. A
            character with the toxoplasm is considered ratkin for the purposes of
            BOND-SPEECH. In addition, the character suffers a penalty die against ratkin in
            social conflicts. The character might be able to use LITTER BOND (I) after
            living among ratkin for a long while. Requirement: The character is human.
          %dt Secret of Albino Weird (Secret)
          %dd
            The character is an albino, with white fur and red eyes. He suffers a penalty
            die for everything he does in direct daylight, due to his sensitiveness. The
            character also has a weird: in times of stress the character manifests a
            culture-appropriate magical Secret of the player’s choice; if the Secret
            requires the use of an Ability, the Ability can be substituted by BESTIALITY
            (V). If the character learns the Secret in question, swap the weird to a
            different Secret. The Secret may also be swapped prematurely in a
            life-threatening situation. Cost: 1 REASON to use, 3 INSTINCT to force the
            Secret to swap to another one.
          %dt Key of the Litter (specify)

          %dt Key of the Rat King
          %dd
            The character’s litter has a very close relationship, to such a degree that
            they rarely disagree or do anything alone. Their combined force of will makes
            them natural leaders of the horde. 1xp: Act together with your litter. 3xp:

            that came before you were. 5xp: Institute a practice emulating the civilization
            you perceive. Buyoff: Have humans explain it all to you.

            The character is something of a comical interlude in the campaign, with
            considerably less drama to his content than other characters. 1xp: Obsess over
            or gobble cheese. 2xp: Have funny antics. 5xp: Impress the rest of the group

      %p
        My experience playing with ratkin was for the longest time that they are a
        problem, not a solution: it always seems that when you start playing TSoY with
        a new group, there is inevitably one player who gravitates towards a ratkin (or
        goblin for that matter) player character over any other option – this always
        seems to be because that player wants to avoid PROTAGONISM: his ratkin
        character is a hanger-on with no discernible issues of his own and seemingly no
        other function in the campaign than to attack squealing vigorously against
        whoever happens to threaten the real main characters. The ratkin with its
        humorous appearance and inhuman immunity to human issues is the perfect
        hanger-on character for the player who couldn’t care less about making a real
        effort in the game.
      %p
        This all changed when I figured out that I should not be moaning the fact that
        some of my friends wanted to play sidekicks; I should embrace it. When you have
        something like four players in the game, where’s the problem in allowing one or
        even two to play unabashed sidekicks? Removing ratkin wouldn’t remove this
        need, and why would we need more than a couple of heroic leads, anyway? Looking
        at it this way, ratkin are perfect: they’re comedic and sympathetic, can be
        completely inefficient in messing up the game, and suitably compact to fit in
        the hero’s backpack. The KEY OF CHEESE is an example of this shift in my
        strategy: I can support the comedic role actively, and I should.
      %p
        This is not to say that ratkin can’t be used seriously; they do certainly have
        many fascinating and serious aspects. I am personally especially fond of their
        nature as genuinely non-human people in Near, outside the Human Equation and
        one of the beastkin. I consider it a fully valid thematic challenge to ask a
        ratkin character to prove that he is actually people and not just an animal, in
        whatever manner a given campaign would consider such an issue.

        %p
          I personally like to think that ratkin have spread out from Maldor and mostly
          appear in there and the surrounding lands, such as Ammeni and Khale. They are a
          versatile lot, of course, and breed fast, so no place is inconceivable.
        %p
          However, Maldor and ratkin go together like bread and butter for me simply
          because the ratkin are such a perfect foil for a campaign situated in Maldor.
          Players of WARHAMMER of course know what I’m about here: in the world of that
          game the human Empire (quite reminiscent of Maldor) is being besieged by evil
          ratkin called Skaven, monsters that come at night from under the floorboards.
          The ratkin in TSoY are not such a clear-cut evil, but the principle is the
          same: rigid civilization is being challenged by unbridled savagery that breeds
          under the very noses of the Lords of Maldor.
        %p
          A Story Guide can get quite a lot of mileage out of ratkin in Maldor even if no
          player character initially has anything to do with them: ratkin can feature as
          members of a revolutionary movement, as barbarians at the gates, as inhuman
          pests carrying pestilence, as assassins or spies and many other things besides.
          If nothing else, Maldorian Lords have been known to pay an extermination fee
          for the pesky critters, which is sure to make for passionate inter-species
          relations.

          I’ve never gotten much out of ratkin in Ammeni; the thing with seemingly
          sub-human creatures in Ammeni is that they can be enslaved and exploited, but
          goblins are so much better for that that ratkin are mostly left as pests to be
          exterminated. This of course makes them natural allies to the slave class of
          the society, but that’s true of goblins as well. I’ve been told that ratkin
          with their litter bond make for a reliable slave species naturally inclined to
          be vulnerable to threats towards their litter-mates, so who knows.
        %p
          Khaleans, on the other hand, have some resonance with ratkin, as their
          communal, ancestry focused culture harmonizes with ratkin nature. A whole
          Khalean tribe made of ratkin makes perfect sense, insofar as they can adapt to
          living in the wilderness.
        %p
          Gorenite highlands, the eastern archipelago and the whole southern continent
          are relatively inhospitable to the natural strengths of the ratkin. I might
          have some appear anywhere humans live, but they could hardly be numerous.

        The TSoY theory is that non-humans are just as likely to share the mainstream
        culture as they are to develop their own, depending on conditions. Consequently
        we get ratkin adopting human names, which might seem funny to humans. A
        civilized ratkin might well use the second name of their human best friend, for
        example.
      %p
        In practice I often find myself using the sort of animal-sounding guttural,
        punchy names we’ve all learned from Disney and whatnot. Or purely descriptive
        primitivist names, “Black Paw” and such. Not an issue as far as I’m considered.
        Sometimes low-Reason ratkin of mine don’t even have a spoken name, as they
        don’t strictly speaking need it with their litter.

    %p
      In days long gone by, Maldor was an empire, stretching from ocean to mountain,
      uniting the people of the world under one rule. Empowered by a common language
      and efficient trade, this cornucopia of cultures melded into an economic
      powerhouse where few were hungry and most were happy.
    %p
      This empire fell, not to opposing armies, but doom from the heavens. A fiery
      dot appeared in the sky, bright enough to be seen in midday. The people,
      well-off but superstitious, grew restless, worried at what this apparition
      might bring. Absolon, Emperor-General of Maldor, gathered his astronomers and
      they examined the fire on the edge of existence.
    %p
      Their counsel was dark. This dot seemed to grow larger by day, as if the sky
      itself was beginning to burn away. Within three months, this dot grew as large
      as the sun, and shone bright by night, causing fear and panic in Absolon’s
      kingdom. Mothers held their crying children to their breasts, trying to block
      the fell rays of this celestial fire from their babies' eyes; peasants grew
      fearful as their beasts moaned in confusion at night; priests proclaimed the
      end of the world was coming. And all looked to their Emperor, Absolon, for
      guidance, but Absolon had none.
    %p
      A foreign magician, Hanish, came before Absolon, hundreds of miles of dirt
      caked on his body from running. He swore that the rituals conducted by
      Absolon's sorcerers had unleashed this terror, and it must be revoked, else the
      world would be destroyed.
    %p
      The court sorcerers heard this and were none too pleased. They had Hanish
      imprisoned and tried to turn Absolon's ear away from his ravings. The words
      bothered Absolon greatly, though, and he went to Hanish's cell on a dark night,
      when the clouds obscured the burning among the stars.
    %p
      Absolon threatened Hanish with death if this curse was not removed from the
      world. Hanish laid himself before Absolon's sword. Moved by Hanish's bravery
      and defiance, Absolon took him to his side as his highest advisor and they
      spent many hours talking alone.  Rumors and rebellions ripped Maldor apart. The
      people said their Emperor spent all his days privately conversing with the man
      who would destroy the world.  Within another three months, this fiery orb
      illuminated everything in burnt red. The sun could not even be seen.
    %p
      In the midst of open revolt, chaos, madness, prophets proclaiming the death of
      all life, assassinations, and depravity, Absolon and Hanish emerged from the
      Emperor's quarters. The Sky Fire had grown no bigger than half the sky, but its
      heat was now intolerable and the entire sky was painted in eternal sunset as
      the globe burned away the air.
    %p
      Absolon and Hanish stood on the steps of the Emperors Palace, hand in hand, and
      began a weird chant, intoning ancient syllables which spread throughout the
      angry crowds outside, calming them. This chant lasted for three days, and it is
      said that by the end of those three days, the entire Empire had taken up its
      rhythmic syllables. The Fire moved slowly across the sky, though, and at the
      end of the three days, crossed the western horizon and night fell again.
      Absolon and Hanish collapsed on the stairs where they chanted, their spirits
      gone and bodies broken.
    %p Then, the world halted.
    %p
      In the midst of night, the world shook with such a rumble that buildings fell,
      cracks opened spewing lava, and mountains formed out of plains-land. Men wept
      and tore their clothes, animals stampeded, and the elderly died of shock. A red
      glow came from every horizon, with black smoky clouds billowing. The clouds
      grew and grew as the earth continued to shake for days on end, the sun barely
      visible, and finally even blotted out that orb of life-giving light.
    %p
      For a year, the earth quivered and the sun rose no more, with only black clouds
      looking down on humanity. The earth froze. For one year, through the harshest
      of winters, people died of plague, starvation, and madness. By the end of that
      year, the population of the known world was a tenth of what it had been.
    %p
      One year after its disappearance, the sun rose weakly in the sky, barely
      shining through the breaking clouds. People driven to primitivism stuck their
      heads out of their caves, hovels, and homes to see the beloved sun as it rose
      to the middle of the sky and the foul darkness broke around it. When it set,
      though, living persons everywhere shook with horror.
    %p
      A moon rose in the sky. Never had a moon been seen in the world. The only
      object ever seen in the night sky was the dread Sky Fire, which this bore too
      much a resemblance to. Its pale light threw dark shadows onto the land. Worse,
      when the sun rose the next day, this moon – three times larger – eclipsed the
      sun, a black Shadow Moon rimmed in fire.
    %p
      Three hundred years have passed. Every night, the moon still rises, a terrible
      eye over the world. Some people quiver in abject fear. And some heroes fight
      the Shadow, in the darkest caves, the most decayed of civilizations, and the
      blackest hearts.
