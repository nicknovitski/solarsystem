      %code The Shadow of Yesterday
      (known as TSoY among friends) is a roleplaying game of
      fantastic, passionate adventure in a world struggling to knit itself together
      after everything almost ended. Players of the game create a world of stories
      about the brave people who join this struggle and shape the face of the world
      to come.
    %p
      TSoY uses a rules system called

        %code Solar System
      a game of dramatic adventure. The
      Solar System is a generic rules system, which means that it can be used for
      many different stories in all sorts of imaginary worlds. It was, however,
      originally created for The Shadow of Yesterday, for which it is uniquely
      suited. The Solar System is available in many different forms and languages on
      the Internet and in game stores.

      an

      is about. This book provides the setting in a language compatible with the
      Solar System rules. We also discuss how the setting can be used when playing a
      Solar System campaign set in Near.
    %h2#history-of-near History of Near
    %p
      The Shadow of Yesterday was originally self-published in 2004 by Clinton R.
      Nixon, a canny roleplaying game designer and IT professional. At this time the
      game book included both setting and rules in one book. The second edition
      followed pretty quickly in 2005, as Clinton honed the rules system, now also
      published separately under the moniker of “Solar System”. The game has been
      pretty widely available both in game stores and the Internet in different forms
      since then.
    %p
      Clinton as a programmer is an ardent supporter of the open source movement,
      which has through the years weighted increasingly on his work as a game
      designer as well. TSoY has from its first edition on been available for free
      under the CREATIVE COMMONS licensing scheme, first under the non-commercial
      license, then without even that limitation. In 2008 Clinton released all of his
      other game designs under similar terms, completing his move towards pure open
      culture.
    %p
      The open nature of TSoY has helped it become a relatively successful game in
      terms of popularity. I myself published a Finnish translation of the game in
      2006 with Clinton’s support, and the game has been translated to other
      languages as well. Perhaps even more significantly, Clinton has been steadfast
      in his support of not only freedom from expense, but also freedom in thought:
      The Shadow of Yesterday has developed through these few short years into a
      community project, with many people all over the world interpreting the game
      and reinventing it to their needs.
    %p
      In 2008, after discussing the matter with Clinton himself, I myself decided to
      take up his challenge and do what those licenses are meant to do: I would
      create new products for the game, gathering and refining the various Internet
      discussions about Near and the Solar System rules into a new round of finished
      products. At this point I decided to split The Shadow of Yesterday into two
      separate texts: there would be SOLAR SYSTEM, the rules of the game separated
      from the fantasy setting, and THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY, a new, expanded edition
      of the setting information. This would encourage friends of the system to use
      it for other things as well, and meanwhile the setting book could be wholly
      dedicated to its own purpose, making for a leaner, meaner reference and a more
      ample and passionate reading experience. We shall see how that works out.
    %h2#what-is-tsoy What is TSoY?
    %p
      The Shadow of Yesterday is a fantasy roleplaying game that is very much defined
      by its peculiar setting, NEAR. Clinton characterizes it as “pumpkin fantasy”,
      akin to that genre of fantasy literature in which young boys leave the farm,
      take up the sword, learn of their world and their place in it, and ultimately
      redeem everything.
    %p
      Aside from pumpkin fantasy, a major influence for many of us working on TSoY
      has been the idea of pulp aesthetics as a counterpoint to genrified
      post-Tolkien, post-D&amp;D fantasy literature: Near is a very organic world (some
      would call it “gritty”) that draws pretty freely from sword &amp; sorcery imagery
      and encourages stories to go where they will regardless of conventional
      structure. So there is a definite tension between uplifting heroism and
      literary realism in this material. It is a fruitful tension that I have seen no
      need to resolve: TSoY is at once sentimental and pragmatic; it is always
      exciting to sit down to play and see what we bring to being this time.
    %p
      This is not to say that The Shadow of Yesterday is a generic fantasy game that
      suits anything and everything. To the contrary, Near has a very definite feel,
      one that is easy to recognize, as anybody who’s witnessed our frequent forum
      discussions on expanding and detailing Near can attest. To wit, Clinton even
      wrote these principles into his book:
    %ul
      %li
        No monsters: The occasional wild animal happens, but the real threats and
        antagonism reside in characters with understandable motivation.
      %li
        No gods: Mankind of Near shapes their own destiny.  This is not to say that
        faith has no power, but no gods will judge or redeem the world.
      %li
        Only people: Good and evil happen for a reason. That reason is somebody
        making them happen.
    %p
      Stories of Near are humanistic stories, and even when the protagonists might
      not be human, they are still people, and their fates speak to us on that level.
      Read this as a refutation of certain sorts of fantasy literature and
      roleplaying if you will.
    %p
      There is more to Near in general, such as the Sky Fire and the Year of Shadow,
      but those are incidental matters of history, not underlying thematic purpose.
    %h2#acknowledging-sources Acknowledging Sources
    %p
      I should note that much in this book derives from the community of interested
      roleplayers. While I’ve written the words, often the ideas come from other
      works or discussions we’ve had over the years with others enticed by The Shadow
      of Yesterday. Many of the words I’ve even borrowed directly from others,
      especially Clinton’s to-the-point prose in the original THE SHADOW OF
      YESTERDAY.
    %p
      Aside from Clinton, whose influence is obvious, I have to commend Josh
      Culbertson, a long-term contributor in related forums. His “southern
      initiative”, as I’ve come to call a spate of discussion threads in the spring
      of 2008, was central in inspiring me to take up this work. With Josh’s kind
      permission I’ve adapted freely from his vision in bringing the southern
      continent and other ideas of his into this new form. Anybody interested in the
      origins of many ideas in this book should visit the forums at
      %a.reference{:href => "http://www.indie-rpgs.com"} the Forge
      for the original discussions that gave rise to what
      we have here.
    %p
      In addition to Clinton and Josh there are of course many others whose ideas,
      critique and imagination have contributed in different ways and degrees to my
      work here. At least Troels, Harald Wagener, Dave Michael, Sami Koponen, João
      Mendes and my brother Jari are easy to name, and there are likely many others
      whose names escape me at the moment.
    %p
      Another set of acknowledgement goes to the various people who have helped me
      playtest the materials in the book. These are mostly my local friends who have
      graciously helped out. At least Jari and Sami above, Markku, A-P Lappi, Henrik
      Mikkonen, Pyry and Peitsa Veteli, Satu and Timo Eskelinen, Sipi Myllynen are
      easy to name, and there are probably others I forget. As this book largely
      consists of an editorial reworking of multiple sources mixed with original
      writing and design, I make a point of indicating the main sources of each
      individual chapter in rough terms at the beginning of each. I don’t nitpick
      obsessively over the matter, but that should be enough to help direct the
      reader towards the original sources in each case, if he’s interested.
    %h2#using-this-book Using this book
    %p
      First off, if you’re new to the game and don’t have the Solar System yet, we’ll
      need to fix that. The Solar System is available on the Internet for free, as
      befits its open nature, and you can also buy it in a cheap booklet from yours
      truly. There are several different versions out there from when Clinton
      actively revised the game – look for the “2008 edition” if you can, as that
      uses the same terminology I use here. Easier to follow that way.
    %p
      Looking at the Solar System, it already advises quite a bit in how to latch a
      ready-made setting into the game. Actually, I write about setting up a game in
      general there, so I won’t repeat all that now. This book is special, though, in
      that it has been written with the Solar System in mind. This makes using the
      setting most straightforward.
    %p
      I recommend reading or at least browsing through the whole book before going to
      the game table, especially if you’re the Story Guide. I’ve tried to write this
      in an entertaining manner, and to sort the material so it makes sense as a
      reading experience. The indexes at the end of the book are there to make
      referencing various details easier in play.
    %p
      Traditionally roleplaying settings have been presented in gazetteer format, so
      I should note that this book is arranged a bit differently: TSoY is as a matter
      of method a random-access work wherein geographical logic is not nearly
      definitive: rather, players need to mix and match the material for use in their
      own campaign, connecting the dots between different parts of the book. For this
      reason I decided to arrange the book with readability in mind: in actual play
      you’re going to be skipping all over the place anyway, utilizing the index and
      your own bookmarks heavily, so I might as well organize the book logically as a
      reading experience, thus:
    %dl
      %dt Front Matter
      %dd
        of the book includes introductory material, Story Guiding advice
        and the default CRUNCH LANDSCAPE of TSoY; all material that is necessary for
        most campaigns using this book. Study it well.
      %dt 1st Movement
      %dd
        consists of the material I think of as the “short Near”: it tells of Maldor,
        the empire, and what became of it after the Year of Shadow. I’ve arranged this
        material with internal coherence in mind: if you’re overwhelmed by the extent
        of the setting in whole, the 1st Movement is actually a sort of mini-setting in
        its own right, perfectly playable.
      %dt 2nd Movement
      %dd
        concerns the “Matter of Ammeni”, the steamy northern Near.  Although Clinton
        didn’t originally plan it this way, in practical play the Matter of Maldor and
        Matter of Ammeni tend to become sort of separate: a given campaign in my
        experience rarely tries to encompass material from both, it would simply be too
        sweeping.
      %dt 3rd Movement
      %dd
        is practically Josh Culbertson’s “Southern Initiative” edited through my own
        lens and connected with the rest of the setting. It concerns the lands of the
        southern continent, a Nordic fantasy wilderness that connects and impacts the
        Ruined Empire from across the ocean in unpredictable ways.
      %dt 4th Movement
      %dd
        presents a powerful general theme of the game, the issue of the Human
        Equation. The different intelligent species of Near are introduced and their
        place in the world discussed. It is a rich and useful additional angle on
        everything that came before. Not mandatory for a lighter campaign by any means,
        but useful for everybody.
      %dt 5th Movement,
      %dd
        finally, is a segue of possibilities. I’ve written this book with an eye
        towards the future and inclusiveness, with no regard for a setting canon. This
        part consequently gathers in one place various ideas, shards and notions that
        might prove fruitful in the future as we continue play and work on this
        imaginary playground of ours.
      %dt Back Matter
      %dd
        includes the essential indexing. This book is pretty extensively concerned
        with rulesmechanical crunch, so I’ve tried to offer enough tools for finding
        what you need in the midst of play.
    %p
      Although I’ve made a point of grouping the material a bit in the above manner,
      do not for a moment entertain the idea that I’d want you to limit your
      practical play to one or two parts of the book. I just found that the book made
      a better reading experience when I gave it slightly more structure than a huge
      dictionary of articles in alphabetic order would have had.
    %h2#to-interpret-canon To Interpret Canon
    %p
      While writing this book I have had to think a lot about what roleplaying game
      settings mean and how my and others’ play of TSoY differs from how setting
      material is usually used in roleplaying. Issues such as “gregging” (the actual
      verb used by Glorantha fans when the canonical setting is changed by Greg
      Stafford) or “metaplot” (a big issue with many ‘90s roleplaying games that
      included a prose narrative that progressed and made changes to the setting of
      the game through various sourcebooks) have made me wonder how come our attitude
      in playing TSoY with its relatively elaborate setting has never stumbled on
      these kinds of issues.
    %p
      I remember vividly how in 2006 or so somebody asked on Clinton’s forums about
      “Oran”, a vaguely referenced land and people that gains hardly a mention in
      Clinton’s TSoY. The answers to that thread consisted of no less than three
      separate visions of what Oran might be – one of them by the creator of the
      setting. Not once in that discussion did we have any confusion about the truth
      of the matter: Oran would have to be, by necessity, whatever a given campaign
      or writer would want it to be, whether that’d be savage falconers, homosexual
      Arabs or a lost colony of the empire. (Check chapter 28 for what I ultimately
      made of that discussion.)
    %p
      This is a lesson in using setting material in roleplaying, one that TSoY puts
      to use in a most fruitful manner: Near as a literary entity is strictly
      secondary to the art performed upon this stage we craft in words and pictures.
      A roleplaying setting must be solid in play, but this does not mean that a
      setting book has to have automatic credibility against the desires of the
      players: the group and the Story Guide (according to his task as backstory
      authority) should consider a setting book, no matter how well-crafted, a series
      of inspiration and suggestions only.
    %p
      I do not write about this because I’d need to explain this ethos to old friends
      of TSoY. I’m explaining a fundamental difference in attitude to new readers so
      that you may understand why there are references never explained, why the
      seemingly objective descriptions differ in content, why all rules systems are
      partially unfinished and why I break immersion all the time to talk about why
      the setting is built the way it is. There simply isn’t any more objective
      reality behind the curtain than we please to pretend from moment to moment in
      our play.
    %h3#nature-of-the-beastNature of the Beast
    %p
      Based on the above, a necessity occurs: just as I don’t consider this book a
      canon to follow, I do not consider it a product so much as a source. By this I
      mean that I find more value in this book as a source of inspiration than as a
      complete, pre-packaged gaming experience.
    %p
      I struggled for a while to find words for what exactly I mean here, so I
      devised a simile: when somebody writes a book about Chess, we do not say that
      his book is Chess. In the exact same way, while this book gives you everything
      you need to start playing TSoY, the book is not THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY itself.
      It’s just a source, of which there are quite a few nowadays, starting with
      Clinton’s original books and ranging through various web materials to
      translated language editions. My hope is that you approach this book like a
      book on Chess: it explains the rules and helps you begin, but it’s not
      everything there is to the game, and it’s certainly not the final authority on
      it. That authority is the Grandmaster who schools you at the board in actual
      play.
    %h3#continuing-from-here Continuing from Here
    %p
      This book is full of material, enough for a hundred campaigns. If there is
      anything you don’t understand, want examples for or want to know more about,
      don’t hesitate to ask me or other TSoY players about our own notions. I love to
      speculate about the Worst War or the Abandoned Coast or how equipment rules can
      be abused, or what lies beyond the Eastern Ocean, and why its name has a
      compass direction when it’s the only Ocean out there. Alongside other things
      this book being a reference work means that it’s supposed to be used in
      conjunction with your real play and other sources, not as a solitary canon.
  %section#campaigning
    %header
      %h1 Campaigning
      %h2 Story Guide Advice
    %p
      This chapter is a summation of notes for the Story Guide working with TSoY.
      This material might not be that interesting or necessary for a player-type, but
      you’ll of course make your own call.
    %h2#the-first-session The First Session
    %p
      The basic procedure for starting a TSoY campaign is for the whole group to
      gather for a planning session, just like I describe in SOLAR SYSTEM. When using
      TSoY, the Story Guide often ends up being the person who has studied the
      setting a bit and imagined using it, so he is in a good position to tell about
      it to the other players. Tell small, general stories, one might say. Answer
      questions. Provide a picture of the sort of stories that will be created and
      the characters that will perform the main roles.
    %p
      Many groups go into this sort of process topdown, by describing a setting in
      general terms of setting history first and continuing to the details. That’s
      fine if the group works well with that sort of approach, but I’ve personally
      found that an ordered top-down process is more for the comfort of the person
      explaining things than for utility: the rest of the group won’t really care and
      perhaps shouldn’t care of the generalities before you’ve nailed down the
      particulars.
    %p
      As an alternative, consider leaving history and geography at the door and
      working with concrete images and concrete situations. What the players need to
      know and want to know is not necessarily the history of Absolon and Hanish
      (page 56), but the fact that now a people lies in slavery while black hearted
      men reach for immortality. If the latter is what excites the group, then
      perhaps that is what should be offered first.
    %p
      When the group has latched onto a FOCAL POINT of the setting, such as the
      ever-popular Zaru slavery issue (chapter 10), character generation can commence
      in relation to this common situation. Players can choose to create characters
      who are directly involved, or they can choose to play outsiders, but the
      important thing is that they know which their character will be by figuring out
      the character’s relationship to the focal point. I’ve managed to make a mess of
      TSoY myself by going into the game characters first, so I can’t stress enough
      the importance of first having the group (or, conceivably, the Story Guide
      alone) choose the focal point around which the campaign will revolve.
    %p
      Near is a big place full of possibilities for play, so an individual campaign
      will never need to have an integral relationship to everything in this book.
      Let go of any need to cross-reference your chosen material any further than
      seems fruitful for actual play. Ignore the parts that seem irrelevant to this
      particular campaign. Embrace setting-definition through the process of play,
      rather than looking for answers in a book.
    %p
      Everything in this setting book is written with a dual purpose: on the one hand
      it is for the players to create their characters, the protagonists of the story
      world the players will create. On the other hand, all the material is usable
      for the Story Guide in preparing the situations he needs to conduct the
      campaign.
    %h2#the-terse-near The Terse Near
    %p
      I am not sure if this is actually necessary for understanding what is to come,
      but in case it is, here is a very compact explanation for the setting of Near,
      the world that is the home for the Empire of Maldor, jungles of Qek and other
      miracles that come later. A Story Guide who prefers a top-down approach might
      start with this when introducing the game to a new group.
    %h3#what-came-before What Came Before
    %p
      Not much is known of Near before the Skyfire. This was the age of myth for most
      cultures on the planet. The most prominent of these myths from Before is the
      Empire of Maldor, to which we’ll return later on.
    %h3#the-skyfire The Skyfire
    %p
      When a fiery dot appeared on the sky, people all over the world were alarmed.
      When it grew larger, they were agitated. The giant asteroid, as such it likely
      was, struck the planet and nearly destroyed everything. If the Myth of the
      Skyfire is to be believed, the Last Emperor and Hanish the foreign magician
      saved the world then.
    %h3#the-year-of-darkness The Year of Darkness
    %p
      After the Skyfire disappeared, the world was cast in darkness as clouds of ash
      rose to the skies. The earth first broke, and then froze. The darkness lasted a
      full year, or perhaps a generation. Nine tenths of the population of Near
      perished, and the survivors were left with nothing.
    %h3#the-moon The Moon
    %p
      When the Year of Darkness ended, the Moon rose to the skies for the first time.
      It was received with fear, and quickly it became the object of superstition and
      magic. The Moon is the part of the world that is now lost, for it broke away
      from Near into a world of its own.
    %h3#what-is-now What is now
    %p
      Now is perhaps a hundred years after the Skyfire. The myth of the Skyfire says
      300 years. The world is being rebuilt, or rediscovered, as only the mightiest
      powers withstood the Year of Darkness unscathed. The world is in flux,
      civilization and life itself still in danger of extinguishing. The world is
      broken, and only courage may rebuild it.
    %p
      I will be providing similar run-downs of individual concepts through the book
      for the benefit of a setting-introducing-person; I know personally how annoying
      it can be to try to info-dump even the bare necessities of a setting to a new
      group. Hopefully some pre-thought paragraphs that can be directly read out will
      help in this a bit.
    %h2#using-the-crunch Using the Crunch
    %p
      Having a book full of rules material makes for a quite different play
      experience with the SOLAR SYSTEM than starting from an empty table would.
      Consequently, the Story Guide might consider how to best leverage the resources
      under his guidance.
    %p
      One thing I myself tend to do is to discourage players from seeing the setting
      material as a selection of character options: not only (as I’ve been repeating
      already in the book) are all the materials in the book only suggestions, but
      the purpose of the setting materials is not so much to encourage character
      optimization as to provide ideas for how to express the fiction of the game in
      the rules mechanics. Sometimes I get players who presume that everything in the
      book is to be considered as resources characters are entitled to, and I think
      that this sort of thing tends to lessen the experience a bit.
    %p
      So what I do instead is to encourage the players to start with simple
      characters that’ll then grow organically through the game into whatever
      direction fate and player choices dictate. As the Story Guide I like to take on
      the job of consulting with the players on how their characters grow and
      develop: the players do not need to go through long lists of character options
      because I’ll be throwing things out for them in the fiction of the game.
      Instead of going through a list of options for what he’d like to spend his
      Advances on, I like to see players work with what the setting is offering: a
      character might encounter an Uptenbo master who offers to teach him, or he
      might decide to become a wizard and seek tutelage in that, or he might have to
      learn advanced survival skills and knot-making in the jungles of Qek just
      because he happened to get stranded there. All of these options and more are so
      much more interesting when they follow and inspire the fiction of the game
      rather than being necessitated by a systematic study of crunch materials
      conducted by a player.
    %p
      Often you need to do nothing more complex than utilize the crunch fully in
      creating secondary characters, and make sure that those characters get to
      engage the game mechanically. For example, a great way to introduce a new
      culture into the game is to create some characters that use the new crunch and
      have them come into contact with a player character. This allows the players to
      see how the new crunch works, inspiring them to consider new options for their
      own character.
    %p
      My point in this is not to ask the Story Guide to limit other players in how
      they engage with the game (this book, as all materials, is for everybody), but
      rather to ask him to consider his responsibilities in the SOLAR SYSTEM to be
      expanded when this sort of crunch-heavy setting is dropped onto his lap: in
      addition to everything else, the Story Guide should now make sure that the
      players do not need to make the reference book their best ally in providing
      exciting character development options. There’s even no need to create your own
      additions to the crunch, just being active and inventive in bringing the
      existing material to the fore is enough. There’s quite a difference in just
      having a given Secret sit on the page as compared to having a character in the
      game actually possess it and be willing to teach it to your character.

      Near is a fantasy world with the makings of your typical historical romance –
      there are humble farmers, evil tyrants, high mountains, wide rivers and all
      that stuff you’d expect. The world is just recovering from disaster as
      fractured societies slowly knit themselves back together, often in completely
      new forms. It’s a time of heroes, as the direction of the world and even its
      very survival are at stake.
    %p
      The numerous cultures of Near have many differences. Their differing values and
      material lifestyles take them into conflict as old routes of travel are opened.
      A big part of the game is to create characters that represent or contrast with
      cultures in the focal point of the campaign; player characters can clash with
      each other as representatives of different cultures, or they can come as
      strangers into such situations.
    %p
      Another large theme of Near is humanity; no gods, no monster as I explained in
      the Introduction. The so-called “old species” are a number of drastically
      different creatures such as humans, goblins and elves, all of which share the
      world and society with each other. Then there are the new creatures that have
      come with the broken world, in their own way both human and bestial. All of
      these people have identity issues that need to be resolved for a hero to truly
      emerge.
    %p
      Finally, Near has magic. Amazing feats are possible for heroes, but only at the
      price of their identity: all magics and other sources of personal power are
      rooted in culture or even species, making the choice of tools a choice of
      values for a hero.

      While TSoY doesn’t fit directly into a given genre, it has a certain feel that
      the Story Guide will do well to consider. TSoY is a very human fantasy, which
      leads to certain rules of thumb when the Story Guide executes his
      responsibilities in dramatic coordination. For instance:
    %dl
      %dt Death:
      %dd
        It is usually not proper in TSoY to have stakes in conflict concern outright
        death of another character. Extended conflicts or helplessness due to Harm are
        thus needed to permanently kill named characters, while extras may die as part
        of narration on the way to objectives. (Note that somebody a player character
        specifically wants to kill can hardly be an extra, can they?) This means that
        usually the Story Guide may only declare player character death as conflict
        issue after a player decides to extend the conflict, not before. Seeming death
        (dropping into a gorge and never leaving a body) is still very much on the
        table, of course.
      %dt Human worth:
      %dd
        Extras are only extras as long as they don’t have names or stated interests.
        There are no social classes or types of people constrained into insignificance
        by genre stricture, as tends to be the case in chivalric romance and most other
        fantasy genres ever since. What this means is that there are no object people
        that are systematically victimized and ignored as sources of conflict without
        dramatic concern for their individuality and intent; anybody may prove
        important, be they slave or king.
    %h2#of-cultural-sources Of Cultural Sources
    %p
      As TSoY is a shared endeavor, I can’t really give a definite list of useful
      sources. I could make a list of the sorts of culture that have influenced me on
      my part when playing in Near, but I desist: it’d just be that same list of
      seminal fantasy literature you’d get from Wikipedia and any number of other
      fantasy roleplaying games: just look for “sword &amp; sorcery”, “pulp fantasy”,
      “pulp horror”, “Tolkien”, “feminist science fiction”, “military scifi”,
      “Glorantha”, “Dungeons &amp; Dragons”, “historical novel”, “libertarianism”,
      “Romanticism”, “neopaganism”.
    %p
      You probably know the seminal authors already, or if you’re young and don’t – I
      can’t guarantee it, but you’ll probably have a much better time reading the
      Masters than my book. In any case TSoY is for me a very wide organic writing
      and playing experience, one that allows me to detach from formulaic
      expectations of genre and just play the setting and rules, playfully shifting
      from genre to genre and throwing cultural references like they were cherry
      pits. I hope the game works the same way for you.
    %p
      I should mention that Clinton gives Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber as the
      main influences of the original TSoY book. You will certainly not be far off if
      that’s the sort of setting you expect, although there are many other things
      here as well.
    %h2#character-creation Character creation
    %p
      The next couple of chapters introduce the core CRUNCH LANDSCAPE for a campaign
      set in Near. There are Abilities, Secrets and Keys that are usually available
      to all characters that want them. Many cultures in the setting use their own,
      more specific crunch for accomplishing some of the things covered here, but
      many concerns are shared by all.
    %p
      When creating characters for THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY, the convention is for the
      player to choose one specific CULTURE his character belongs to. The player then
      creates the character using only the general crunch and the culture-specific
      material for the culture in question. What is a “culture” in this sense is up
      to the group – I could see prohibiting a mixture of crunch specific to certain
      social classes in some lands of Near, for example. The book doesn’t make a big
      deal of this, it doesn’t specifically list which cultures are enough of traders
      to wield the trading crunch in chapter 9, for example. You’ll just have to pay
      attention to the fiction and make choices that fit with your campaign’s intent.
    %p
      The player may also choose to make his character non-human (as opposed to the
      human default, chapter 22), in which case they may not access the
      human-specific crunch but have additional options related to their species.
      Nonhuman characters are still members of a culture just like humans, so they
      can use that crunch as well.
    %p
      I should emphasize that the culture limitation does not mean that characters
      can’t adopt another culture during play; to the contrary, this is often a
      matter of great emphasis in the character’s story. During play crunch is chosen
      normally, so characters can learn anything they have the reasonable background
      or mentors for. The culture limitation is there to emphasize the cultural
      theme, not to limit the fiction itself.
    %p
      It is not uncommon for the group to coordinate so that all the player
      characters are members of the same 1-2 cultures at the focal point of the
      campaign. For example, players might all agree to create characters living in
      the same town in Maldor. The choice to play an outsider in this set-up is a
      strong one as well, for such outsiders naturally become pivots and judges of
      the local situation.
    %p
      Another approach is the classical adventure fantasy paradigm: have all players
      create characters out of the material they are most interested in, getting a
      mix of cultures from all over Near, but also require the characters to be
      severed from their society and already adrift, looking for purpose; some
      heavy-handed dramatic coordination from the Story Guide will then get all of
      these colorful, idiosyncratic individuals mixed up with the focal point of the
      campaign, at which point they can take sides and proceed with the scenario.
      Even a traditional adventure party is a possibility here, at least for a time.
    %h3#default-pools Default Pools
    %p
      Characters for the Shadow of Yesterday are customarily created with 11 Pool
      points distributed between the three default Pools of VIGOR, INSTINCT and
      REASON. They are accompanied by the default PASSIVE ABILITIES, as we’ll see in
      the next chapter.

        %dd
          The character’s capability for enduring physical pain and fatigue, whether caused by
          climate, injury or great exertion. Poisons are a particularly serious example in Near.
        %dt#react-i React (I)
        %dd
          The character’s ability of thinking and acting quickly and clearly, as useful for
          seizing initiative as noticing hidden things. Avoiding traps and ambushes is a typical
          fantasy convention that falls here as well.
        %dt#resist-r Resist (R)
        %dd
          The character’s strength of will and resolve in the face of adversity, stress or
          social pressure alike. Many magics common to Near can be opposed by Resist.
    %p
      Abilities are the “venues of conflict” in Solar System, being the means by
      which heroes channel their will. In TSoY we have a pretty large swath of common
      Abilities available to all characters – for example, a character might choose
      to approach convincing another by the means of CHARM (I), DECEIT (I) or
      SPEAKING (R), and that doesn’t even cover the less generic culture-specific
      options or newly created Abilities. The purpose of this rich texture is to pay
      homage to traditional fantasy adventuring sensibilities: players are encouraged
      to pick up lots of different Abilities for their characters, and it’s easier to
      encounter situations where a character’s Ability is just MEDIOCRE (0) when
      there are lots of different Abilities floating about in the headspace of the
      group.
    %p
      This is not to say that the Story Guide should use the large number of
      Abilities to punish characters; as always, an Ability is only as relevant as
      the group allows it to be. Regardless, the slightly grim environment of Near
      benefits from the fact that players are encouraged to show character
      vulnerabilities, not just strengths. I’ve even been considering a character
      sheet with the common Abilities preset, just so the players don’t forget that
      they can have their character be weak once in a while as well.

      .sidebar
        %p.first.sidebar-title Common Abilities:
        %p.last
          The Common Abilities on the facing page are shared by practically all societies
          in Near. All but the most sheltered characters will know them all at MEDIOCRE
          (0) rank.
      %p
        You won’t go too far wrong if you consider the list of Abilities a list of
        examples only, but there is some hidden wisdom in what I choose to include in
        it. Here’s some advice on handling situations that might be unusual compared to
        how you might expect one to handle the fantasy genre in the SOLAR SYSTEM.
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Intimidation:
        %dd
          Usually I don’t allow this as a conflict. Rather, when characters try to
          intimidate others, the other party chooses whether they succeed and how the
          character will be treated going forward. For example, the Story Guide might
          have the target either buckle under and harbor resentment, or attack the
          intimidating player character outright. Note that if the target of intimidation
          is helpless and refuses to give in, it’s up to the other party to go through or
          not with their threats.
        %dt Healing:
        %dd
          A community of Near won’t necessarily have any dedicated health professionals.
          Lacking any real knowledge, a character may use HOUSEWORK (I) to treat simple
          injuries and illnesses. I usually limit this to the most rudimentary of
          treatments, such as bandages, splints and nursing; when these are insufficient,
          nothing much can be done.
        %dt Fighting:
        %dd
          Aside from BRAWL (V), there is no universal martial discipline available – the
          role of violence is different enough in the various societies of Near. A
          character that wants to be a disciplined martial artist needs to learn such
          arts and mindsets from a specific culture.
        %dt Archery:
        %dd
          Not available to everybody.  In fact, unless you count throwing rocks with
          SPORTS (V), characters wanting to resolve conflicts with missile weapons need
          cultural Abilities. For others missile weapons might delay a conflict or change
          details about it, but the actual resolution will hinge on other things.
        %dt Stealth:
        %dd
          All sorts of sneaking about and hiding cleverly are accomplished with either
          WOODCRAFT (R) or THIEVERY (I), depending on the environs, purpose and the whim
          of the group. Surprising someone to mug or murder them is a fine application of
          THIEVERY (I), for example.
        %dt Forgery:
        %dd
          THIEVERY (I) can deal with this, but only if the character can write in the
          first place. This might require the SECRET OF SCRIBING if the group is using
          that distinction, or it might just require having a background in a literate
          culture like Maldorian courts.
        %dt Lore:
        %dd
          VAGRANCY (I) deals with the news of the present world, STORYTELLING (R) with
          history and stories. I like to use plenty of various lore checks to find out
          where player and character knowledge diverges; the intent is not to hide things
          from the players, but to give them tools for crafting entertaining situations.
          So the player would indeed know that his character is now romancing a witch,
          even if the naive fool himself didn’t. This can then be used by the player in
          portraying his character. If your group isn’t so hot for this sort of thing, no
          need to have lore checks at all.
        %dt Convincing others:
        %dd
          CHARM (I) and SPEAK (R) may well be used to sway another character. In the
          case of player characters, it is a good idea to ask the player of the opposing
          character to validate the conflict stakes, as he is the leading expert at the
          table on what the character might be willing to do; if the player feels that
          his character really can’t be talked over in this situation even with
          circumstantial penalty dice, the conflict may still cause Harm from
          uncertainty, shame or other such social considerations. Thus, instead of “I
          convince him to kill himself out of shame” it’s more reasonable to have stakes
          along the lines of “he takes a MAJOR (4) Harm as I shame him”.
        %dt Arts and crafts:
        %dd
          If it can’t be done with CRAFTWORK (I), chances are that some culture in the
          book holds the lost knowledge. Other cultures make do without.
        %dt Noticing things:
        %dd
          For the most part there are no Abilities for noticing things because noticing
          something is just set-up, not conflict. REACT (I) is used when this is not the
          case, but mostly it should be assumed that the characters notice what they need
          to notice for the scene to find its dramatic purpose.
        %dt Useless Abilities:
        %dd
          This is not so much the case with the common Abilities, but the cultural stuff
          later in the book includes some quite marginal cases. It is good to remember
          several things about this: dramatic coordination can be used to bring narrowly
          useful and exotic Abilities to the fore; the player can play towards his
          Abilities and use even a tenuous connection to justify a support check;
          choosing a weird Ability in itself signals a certain degree of willingness to
          wait and see whether it becomes a dead reminder of the character’s past or a
          surprising, fresh focus for some different play.
        %dt Leverage and Secrets:
        %dd
          TSoY has a boatload of Secrets, much more than can be used during one
          campaign. It is extremely important for the players to understand that only
          content introduced into play is pertinent: disallowing a character from trying
          to set up an ambush with a normal Ability check because the book has a separate
          Secret of Ambushing or an Ambushing Ability somewhere in there would be abusing
          the content; the real crunch landscape of the game is only what the players
          willfully choose to include into their game, not what I might have written into
          this book. If this seems vague, meditate on the SECRET OF LANGUAGE until it
          becomes clear.
      .list.container
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Animal Ken (I)
          %dd Use ANIMAL KEN as the general social Ability for interacting with animals. Domesticated animals may follow orders; wild ones will just understand to go away. Most cultures in Near have domesticated animals that are handled with this Ability. Those cultures that train riding animals either expand this Ability with a Secret or train the rider in a specialized Ability.
          %dt Barter (I)
          %dd Most of Near has devolved into a barter economy, so the rarity of money complicates trade. Experience with trade also allows the character to evaluate the value of things to others. Use BARTER to find out whether a character’s wealth of the moment is enough to make a purchase, or what he might have to sacrifice to make the price.
          %dt Brawl (V)
          %dd Natural propensity for violence, uninformed by any finer discipline. Generally speaking a brawler will fight in a rage and limited in technique, which makes the use of sophisticated weapons inefficient and special technique all but impossible.
          %dt Charm (I)
          %dd Giving good impressions and making friends. Useful in delivering compliments and convincing others by subtle and personal means. The primary Ability for romantic conquest, should an Ability be required.
          %dt Craftwork (I)
          %dd Most cultures have traditions of creating elaborate art from wood, bone or other materials. While HOUSEWORK (R) is enough to create simple tools, this Ability is used when mere function is not enough, but beauty is desired as well. Items created with craftwork may reflect meaning and are reasonable as individual Effects that can influence people in different ways.
          %dt Deceit (I)
          %dd Delivering lies with a straight face, pretty much. Opposed by RESIST (R) when a character tries to perceive the lie for what it is. DECEIT and SPEAKING (R) overlap and support each other naturally when lies are delivered by a glib tongue. I’m not entirely consistent with DECEIT myself all the time; sometimes I allow characters to lie and mislead with CHARM (I). Caveat emptor.
          %dt Hard Work (V)
          %dd Most direct production in Near happens with human labor. Farming and related work is first and foremost about patience, measured use of force and experience. HARD WORK is used whenever characters want to support others with grunt work, or when they end up on the bottom ladder of a working group, or when they want to make their way honestly.
          %dt Housework (R)
          %dd Only the most well preserved or newly advanced communities in Near feature large degrees of specialized labor. Most of what makes people happy and comfortable from day to day is made in the home with this Ability, such as cooking, craftwork, folk medicine and so on. Essential for the functional household. HOUSEWORK may be used to treat simple injuries and illnesses.
          %dt Music (I)
          %dd A character’s skill with instruments and song. Music is beautiful and universal to life in Near, but its usefulness is a subtle thing. Choosing this Ability as a major facet for a character is to choose to chase mirages that only occasionally perform truly. In other words, it takes some work to maneuver the game into a situation where music will be useful in conflict.
          %dt Pray (V)
          %dd This Ability is used to conduct rituals and focus the mind towards a higher power in meditation. Sometimes faith can move mountains, or at least support other Abilities at critical moments.
          %dt Speak (R)
          %dd The skill of explaining yourself well. Useful for arguing a point or delivering a rousing speech. Speaking usually requires some sort of valid point to work from, though. Use SPEAK for any social conflicts where substantial issues decided with reason are at stake.
          %dt Sports (V)
          %dd Sports are an important status practice, especially for men who use them to establish prominence. The same Ability is used to resolve general athletic situations, such as swimming, climbing, jumping and so on.
          %dt Storytell (R)
          %dd All but the most civilized places have lost their literary culture. What they have instead are storytellers, the sons and daughters of people who might have been erudite in their time. This Ability is used to know the old things and tell the truth of them, as well as to combine the old stories into new ones.
          %dt Thievery (I)
          %dd Thievery is experience in casing targets, picking pockets, stealthy entrance, confidence tricks and other unsavory practices that come with societal hostility and willingness to break norms. Experts are unlikely outside major urban centers.
          %dt Vagrancy (I)
          %dd Beggars and vagabonds are common in the Near of today. They learn how to freeload and draw a meager livelihood from the gratitude of strangers. Vagrancy is also useful for knowing things about the wider world. Aside from vagrants, any well traveled character might have this Ability.
          %dt Woodcraft (R)
          %dd Most of Near is temperate, consisting of woodlands, grasslands, wetlands and highlands. This Ability concerns survival skills in these wilderness environments, such as recognizing the flora and fauna, remembering their properties, tracking and trapping them. Extreme environments, such as dense jungle or bare tundra are wont to cause penalty dice, as is simple unfamiliarity with a specific terrain.

      %p
        In actual play of TSoY I’ve long used the Ability list more as a guide than an
        authoritative source for what can be turned into an Ability. Partially this has
        been because I haven’t sat down to sketch my own perfect list until now, but
        part has been the fact that some Abilities should be developed for individual
        campaigns only. For example, if your character concept is an optician or some
        such, and you expect the play to center on how he helps everybody with
        eyeglasses, I simply can’t predict that, and even if I could, all the crunch I
        wrote for the optician would be useless overhead for other campaigns.
      %p
        Thus: remember that this book is a reference, the real crunch landscape is the
        one that is actualized by your individual campaign. It might have quite
        different Ability lists from what this general treatise suggests.

              geographical area, community subculture or other such living environment. The
              character can find people, places and lore related to the locality with this
              Ability, and he is considered a member of the community here.
        %p
          I didn’t put this in the general list because these Abilities need to be
          developed on a per-campaign basis: for a far-traveling campaign you’d want
          something like LOCAL (MALDOR) (R), while for something set in a single,
          sprawling city you’d want LOCAL (KALDERON) (R). Normal Ability-creation in that
          regard.

      %p
        TSoY is more or less a flagship setting for SOLAR SYSTEM, so it’s pretty
        complex. Sometimes characters encounter each other in the weirdest of
        situations and simply have asymmetric Abilities. How to resolve conflicts when
        characters lack obvious Abilities?
      %p
        The precept of Solar System is that Abilities simultaneously reflect character
        identity and allowable venues of conflict resolution. What this boils down to
        is that a character that lacks a MEDICINE (R) Ability, say, can’t resolve
        conflicts through this venue; he fails automatically when the issue is whether
        a disease will run its course or not. The only way for the group to avoid this
        stark reality is by manipulating the TURNING-POINT of the conflict: perhaps the
        issue is not whether a character can heal another, but whether he can travel
        quickly enough to bring a remedy from far away? Or perhaps success depends on
        being able to convince a traveling doctor to help? As long as the player can
        re-frame a problem in terms his character understands, he can tackle the
        conflict from the new direction and be victorious.
      %p
        When two characters conflict against each other, both have a say in where the
        turning-point of the conflict forms. For example, if the issue is over a
        military campaign conducted by imperial Maldor using BATTLE (R) against a
        primitive tribe without similar strategic culture, it might well be that the
        imperial forces would win with a simple, uncontested Ability check: their
        tactical supremacy allows them to win the war without a fight. A player
        character on the other side, however, is well within his rights to influence
        the unfolding narrative to include a concrete fight scene wherein his
        character’s BRAWL (V) or other melee combat Abilities come to determine the
        fate of the war: whether the war between an empire and a primitive tribe comes
        down to brawling or logistics or some completely different Ability is a nuanced
        dance of scene framing, narration, player initiative and stakes negotiation: I
        can’t give a straight answer because this largely is the game of SOLAR SYSTEM.

    %p
      While most of the really cool stuff is found in the cultural write-ups, Near
      does have an array of generic Secrets available to all characters. The purpose
      of these Secrets is simple: they’re here to cover all the really basic stuff
      that should be assumed as a baseline for all characters. The color is also
      generic and concerns simple things like “this character hits really hard” –
      players should feel free to embellish here to whatever degree they want.
    %p
      Another, traditional reason for the general Secret list is that it sort of sets
      the tone and helps newcomers get a grip on character creation. Mostly the
      general list provides grounding for fantasy tropes – they show simple tricks
      that you’d expect to encounter in the fantasy genre, providing a basis for when
      you want to develop more simple stuff yourself. I often set up new players with
      the open list, telling them to browse it through a bit to get a sense for what
      sorts of things characters in TSoY are expected to do and have.
    %p
      Culturally the group may wish to assume that all civilizations of Near have
      their own tricks and heritage that is culturally different but amounts to the
      same thing mechanically. Thus the SECRET OF MIGHTY BLOW of a Maldorite might in
      the fiction represent different martial training than it does for a Khalean,
      for example. Alternatively, a given Secret, such as the SECRET OF BODHISATTVA,
      might genuinely be universal, so that two enlightened characters from opposite
      sides of the world recognize in each other the same truth. It depends on the
      Secret; I’d assume it obvious that something like the SECRET OF CONDITIONING
      requires some back-story specification to find out where the mechanical effect
      comes from for this character. I might gloss over it in practice with a group
      that doesn’t care, but were the issue to ever come up, having an explanation is
      a nice addition to the fiction.

      %h3
        %a#cultural-strengths{:name => "cultural-strengths"} Cultural Strengths
      %p
        Later, in the actual culture write-ups, there are headings for “Cultural
        Strengths”. Under these I have long lists of suggestions for how to adapt some
        of the more generic common Secrets for the culture in question. For example, I
        might list “specializations”, which are suggestions for how to use the SECRET
        OF SPECIALTY with that culture.
      %p
        Traditionally this sort of content would have been written into separate
        Secrets to emphasize how this culture is really good at swimming or whatever,
        but that goes a bit old, isn’t that helpful to you and takes a lot of space,
        frankly, so I stopped doing it and just listed everything in one long list. I
        try to separate only Secrets that have somehow strange mechanics or are
        otherwise notable.
      %p
        One thing the players might wish to do (and which was explicitly done in
        earlier editions of TSoY) is to make common Secrets based on cultural strengths
        just the slight bit more powerful than any old implementation a player might
        grab. This could range from allowing an abnormally wide specialization to
        picking two generic Secrets under one heading. This is all fine, as the Secrets
        featured in Cultural Strengths are mostly pretty low-key stuff anyway. Thus, to
        pick an old TSoY example, the SECRET OF SWAMP LORE would be a Zaru SECRET OF
        SPECIALIZATION that also expanded the usage of WOODCRAFT (I) a bit.
      %p
        This might go without saying, but do treat those lists of cultural strengths as
        a list of examples to be added to as the group’s understanding of the given
        culture increases. Here more than anywhere else I just sat down and typed
        whatever came to mind, there is no great plan behind the free association that
        went into this particular piece of crunch.

        While most of the general Secrets are mechanically simple, this is a good place
        to introduce some overriding mechanical principles I’ve worked with while

        rules, some are optional rules. See for yourself.

        %p
          This one always comes up, especially in the TSoY crunch landscape: when a
          player wants to start play with an Effect or a piece of equipment, do they pay
          Pool for it?
        %p
          I used to not worry about this, but the players actually seem to be happier if
          the mechanics are followed in a robust manner. So yes, have the character pay
          Pool for each Effect you roll for him in character creation. The character
          starts play with somewhat expended Pools.
        %p
          Real tough guys might want to craft several items for their character at
          character creation with the SECRET OF CREATION, as opposed to just talking it
          over with the Story Guide and setting appropriate statistics for the equipment.
          If it’s just one piece, handle it like Effects, above. If it’s several, assume
          that the character refreshes his Pools after each project. Equipment is so
          expensive to create that few characters could make more than one without
          refreshment.

        %h4
          %a#pool-spend-caps{:name => "pool-spend-caps"} Pool Spend Caps
        %p
          I noticed in writing this book that there is a boatload of Secrets in here that
          work with the Solar System Pool spending limitations. It’s that small rule that
          says that characters can buy exactly one bonus die for an Ability check with a
          Pool point from the associated Pool, but no more than one, and not from other
          Pools.
        %p
          In this text I call this rule the “Pool spend cap” of a given Ability,
          associated with a certain Pool. Thus, when I say that a Secret “removes the
          Pool spend cap”, that means you get to spend as much Pool as you want on those
          bonus dice. Pretty simple, I just thought it better to mention this for
          clarity’s sake.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#superior-leverage{:name => "superior-leverage"} Superior Leverage
        %p
          Many Secrets in the book reference this concept. You can read about the
          theoretical background I went through with it in chapter 4, but it’s better to
          mention it here as well.
        %p
          When a character has “superior leverage”, it’s just my technical speak for the
          fact that his position in the fiction makes it infeasible for his opponents to
          engage him in conflict. For example, a character standing on top of his house
          and throwing rocks at his enemies has superior leverage – he can hurt his
          enemies, but they can’t feasibly hurt him. Superior leverage is the next step
          down from two circumstance penalty dice: the situation is even worse for the
          opponent.
        %p
          When a character has superior leverage, conflict rules are not engaged at all:
          the opponent loses the conflict automatically, one might say. One might also
          take the situation into extended conflict were one so inclined, but superior
          leverage works there as well: if the opponent insists on attacking the superior
          leverage directly, he will lose every round of conflict automatically.
        %p
          The proper method for working around superior leverage is not to engage in
          conflict; the whole idea of the concept is to formalize and speak about the
          situations in fiction where everybody from audience down understands that
          conflict is not feasible. Like escaping stormtroopers in STAR WARS, nobody in
          the audience questions Luke &amp; Han’s choice to not attack and try to conquer the
          Death Star singlehandedly.
        %p
          Rather, characters work their way around superior leverage by avoiding it.
          Change the conditions so you don’t need to encounter strength with weakness. If
          your opponent has superior leverage in a debate, stab him. If he has too many
          stormtroopers, try to talk them over. Or perhaps bring in your own superior
          leverage to match him, if you can.
        %p
          Often characters can engage superior leverage meaningfully with PARTIAL
          conflict stakes, where the weaker party has less to win and more to lose. While
          the opponent might hit you with a stone and injure you, you might be able to
          get up to the roof to attempt restraining him in a further conflict, for
          example.
        %p
          Last, to clarify: superior leverage is a judgment on the fiction of the game,
          one which the Story Guide makes when assigning stakes for the conflict. Some
          crunch might explicitly assign a character with superior leverage in certain
          situations, but this doesn’t mean that the Story Guide can’t give it to anybody
          by declaration. This is a normal part of the leverage evaluation the Story
          Guide does in the SOLAR SYSTEM rules: conflicts are only ever played out when
          both parties have some chance of success.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#overflow-dice{:name => "overflow-dice"} Overflow dice
        %p
          Some Secrets, such as the equipment rules (chapter VI), make use of the concept
          of OVERFLOW DICE. These are any dice that were left over after choosing the
          three best or worst dice in an Ability check. So if you rolled a total of five
          dice, for example, then you’d necessarily have two dice left over after
          choosing the three that actually contribute to the check result. Those are the
          overflow dice.
        %p
          Obviously enough, when you have overflowdependent crunch in play, don’t mess up
          the dice on the table when rolling. Technically, the overflow does not go away
          before the whole Ability check procedure ends, as it’s possible to add bonus
          and penalty dice into the roll several times, which also adds to the overflow
          again and again.
        %p
          When using overflow dice, I allow players to choose freely to downgrade their
          result to modify their overflow. So if you really want a ‘+’ die in your
          overflow and have one in your standing dice, go on and switch the ‘+’ die out.
          I sometimes even allow desperate players to roll extra penalty dice into their
          check if they really must get overflow any way they can; feel free to
          experiment with this, these are pretty new rules compared to most of the SOLAR
          SYSTEM toolbox.
        %p
          What you actually do with overflow dice depends on the Secrets that use them,
          but the general idea is that I wanted to create an array of Secrets that would
          make high numbers of bonus dice a bit more useful for the dedicated character.
          TSoY has traditionally had a pretty bonus-dicey crunch landscape, so rolling a
          +3 in an Ability check has not been that difficult; with the idea of overflow
          dice we can create crunch that rewards or punishes the excess dice.
        %p
          Overflow dice that are used for some purpose are always consumed from the
          table. This mostly matters if you have some wacky crunch that uses the overflow
          in several different ways.

          %a#aggravated-harm{:name => "aggravated-harm"} Aggravated Harm
        %p
          Several Secrets in the book use the concept of AGGRAVATED Harm, which, as you
          might imagine, is always some sort of extra annoying Harm. Aggravated Harm does
          not shake down and is not associated with a Pool, and can’t thus be healed
          naturally. Often specific sources describe even worse effects.
        %p
          Healing Abilities work normally on aggravated Harm. I also allow a healer to
          make an Ability check to turn all aggravated Harm equal or under the check
          result into normal Harm, which also shakes the Harm down.

        %p
          A central theme of TSoY on the most primordial poetic level is the eponymous
          shadow of yesterday. In my play this seems to come up as all sorts of flashback
          mechanics and other weird non-chronological storytelling devices. They don’t
          make an appearance often, but they are regulars in the toolbox.
        %p
          My general principle for playing scenes in nonchronological order is to refuse
          to engage in retooling character sheets. We just use the character exactly as
          he happens to be. This makes certain sorts of narrative sense (that is, this is
          how movies work), and it saves work, too. If a character is different enough in
          two time-frames, my solution of choice is to write him up as a new character
          when necessary.
        %p
          Players always play their own characters in all scenes when I play, even if
          we’ve sort of established that they did some things in the past that they now
          need to re-enact. I remind the players of what we already know, but they play
          their characters freely; that’s one of the dangers of a real flashback scene.
        %p
          When non-chronological scenes contradict established facts, a character who is
          telling the story or experiencing the memory gets to make a STORYTELLING (R)
          check so we can find out how believable this version of the events is. Others
          can conflict the story, of course. I’ve never had this happen, but I suppose
          that this method could be used between time-frames to find out which timeframe
          is actually the primary one if the game timejumps (in memories,
          non-chronological telling or actual time travel) a lot and the players are
          confused.
        %p
          Lastly: the Story Guide can always opt to replace a narratively difficult scene
          with a CUT SCENE: instead of playing a scene, one player (often the Story
          Guide) makes an expository monologue before the game continues. This is always
          the case when there are no player characters in the scene.

        %h4
          %a#limited-effects{:name => "limited-effects"} Limited Effects
        %p
          This is a variant rule I’ve found worth considering in TSoY, at least for some
          groups. The idea is that while Near is supposed to be pretty grim at times, the
          game mechanics actually provide quite a kick for characters if the players
          start really working with all the crunch available. Effects from SOLAR SYSTEM
          rules can especially be leveraged in some interesting ways with the crunch in
          this book. Gift dice don’t fare well in this environment, as their impact is
          lessened by players wielding large inherent dice pools.
        %p
          If the group feels that their game has too many bonus dice floating around,
          they might consider LIMITED EFFECTS: have Effects spent for bonus dice be
          limited to one die per check, just like Pools are. For an extra-grim take,
          count each Effect under the Pool spend cap of the Pool it derives from (rather
          than allowing one die from each Effect). In this latter method Effects are
          still worthwhile in that they save Pool for the character and might allow a
          character to tap on the Pool spend caps of several Pools when an Effect is
          applicable to a situation where the Effect and the Ability are from different
          Pools.
        %p
          It would also make sense to apply this rule only in extended conflict, akin to
          how support checks from secondary Abilities are limited.
        %p
          I’ve played both with and without this rule, and it’s not nearly mandatory.
          Rather, just like all alternate rules, it’s something to take up when and if
          the problem (too many dice in this case) comes up in play.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#fragile-effects{:name => "fragile-effects"} Fragile Effects
        %p
          Another variant rule in the same vein concerns Effects in another use, as
          direct resistance against Ability checks in conflict. Some crunch in TSoY
          provides characters with potentially pretty powerful Effects that protect them
          from other characters. Gorenite RITUAL WORKINGS, Ammenite ALCHEMY and giant
          ONE-EYES are good examples; they can be very unforgiving, almost a done deal
          against a low-Ability character.
        %p
          If the group starts to feel that such Effects protect characters too much and
          result in dramatic duds, they may consider FRAGILE EFFECTS: under this rule all
          Effects that participate in conflict directly lose an Effect level regardless
          of the conflict outcome; thus Effects ablate in use. If the opponent wins and
          tries to destroy the Effect, it is immediately destroyed, just like always.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#circumstance-penalties-to-effects{:name => "circumstance-penalties-to-effects"} Circumstance Penalties to Effects
        %p
          One last variant rule concerning Effects, or rather a Story Guide option. When
          a character encounters adverse circumstances, he suffers circumstance penalty
          dice to his Ability check. This same rule can be extended to Effects in
          advanced play by considering the Effect’s value to be one level less for each
          level of current circumstance penalty. Thus an AMAZING (4) angry mob might
          operate as just GREAT (3) in horrid weather conditions. Simple.
        %p
          I wouldn’t worry about these details with a soft beginner-type group, but if
          the group is playing hard-ball with some of the more advanced applications of
          the rules, this might become worthwhile.

          %a#game-balance{:name => "game-balance"} Game Balance
        %p
          Because this comes up pretty often both in play and discussions, I feel that I
          should mention it explicitly here: the purpose of SOLAR SYSTEM crunch is
          usually not to be “balanced” in the sense of providing all players with
          different characters a fair shot at overcoming each other or some imaginary
          opposition in a wrestling match. To the contrary, different crunch provided in
          the game is nothing more or less than what it seems like: itemized points of
          contact between the fictional matter and mechanics of the game. The only
          balance here concerns upholding meaningful gameplay while focusing attention
          and inspiring outcomes.
        %p
          I’ve discussed this in the actual SOLAR SYSTEM rules, but it really is
          important: the very idea of playing TSoY is to deck up a couple of bad-ass
          fantasy heroes and bash them together until one’s brains come out. A themeful
          story is created when we, as audience, make judgments not only of who was
          stronger, but also who was more in the right and who would have deserved to
          win. This has nothing to do with game balance, having a hero doomed to lose
          because his cultural crunch sucks in comparison to his opponent just stacks the
          deck towards a certain story outcome. This is good, because in SOLAR SYSTEM we
          enjoy those points of contact and don’t want equalized 50/50 chances.

              The character can bless endeavors, tools and places with a ritual of his
              faith. The player makes a PRAY (V) check to create the blessing as an Effect
              which is then moved to the recipient’s character sheet. Blessing Effects are
              spent as bonus dice; usually they manifest in the fiction only subtly, but when
              Keys are activated simultaneously, supernatural light effects or such might
              happen as well. Blessing Effects are not affected by Pool spend caps under the
              LIMITED EFFECTS variant rule. Cost: as per normal for Effects.
            %dt Conditioning (Pool)
            %dd
              The character has been especially conditioned in one of his Pools, either
              intentionally or by cruel fate. The Pool spend cap is increased by one for the
              Pool; while others can only spend one Pool point per Ability check on bonus
              dice, this character can spend two from this Pool. This Secret can be purchased
              multiple times.
            %dt Contacts
            %dd
              The character is well-traveled and knows people in many places. A VAGRANCY (I)
              or LOCAL (R) check is enough to establish that the character has in fact
              visited a given place in the past. The player may also activate this Secret to
              establish that his character has a pre-existing relationship to another
              character in the game; the player describes the relationship with a short
              phrase, while the controller of the other character establishes the attitude of
              the other character and the current state of the relationship. Cost: 1 POOL for
              locations, 3 for characters, Pool mix chosen by the Story Guide: VIGOR for
              buddies, INSTINCT for lovers and REASON for colleagues, for example.
            %dt Counsel
            %dd
              The character knows how to heal broken spirits. Sometimes this is taught, but
              most often it is instinctual kindness. When the character advises another and
              the advice is accepted, the player may make an appropriate emotional Ability
              check such as PRAY (V), MUSIC (I) or STORYTELL (R) to heal mental or social
              Harm for the target. Cost: 1 appropriate Pool
            %dt Culture (specify)
            %dd
              The character loves his people. He can use any CULTURAL STRENGTHS listed for
              the culture in question as if he had the corresponding Secret. Cost: 1 POOL
              appropriate to the situation.
            %dt Dark Rhetoric
            %dd
              The character may impose the KEY OF DESPERATION upon another character with a
              successful SPEAK (R) check. The target may RESIST (R), of course. The target
              pays for the Key normally, going into Advance debt if necessary. Cost: 2
              Instinct. Requirement: KEY OF DESPERATION
            %dt Day Labor
            %dd
              The character does not pay Pool to create Effects with the HARD WORK (V)
              Ability as long as he doesn’t possess any Vigor-based Effects.
            %dt Enhancement (Ability)
            %dd
              The character has a heroic Ability that does not have a Pool spend limit. This
              might be because of specialized initiation, exotic training or simply from
              being so cool. Regardless, the Pool spend cap for this Ability is lifted
              altogether: the player can buy however many bonus dice he wants for this
              Ability.
            %dt Experience
            %dd
              Whenever the character does something notable, the player may choose to record
              his Ability check as a free Effect under this Secret. These Effects are free of
              Pool costs, but they cannot be used during the session they were recorded.
              Later the Effects can be used normally when the character encounters situations
              similar to his past experience.
            %dt Herbal Medicine
            %dd
              The character has studied natural remedies. A WOODCRAFT (R) check allows him
              to know and locate suitable herbs to treat most injuries and illnesses. The
              check may directly heal Harm or allow further checks to treat the patient (e.g.
              HOUSEWORK (R)). Cost: 1 REASON
            %dt Home Set (specify)
            %dd
              The character has a milieu particularly important to him. The player can make
              an appropriate LOCAL (R) check to force the next scene to happen there. The
              Story Guide can make the obligatory scene a cut scene if he wants. Cost: 1
              INSTINCT
            %dt Inner Meaning
            %dd
              The character’s art has an expressive spark to it regardless of his level of
              skill. A piece of art created with CRAFTWORK (I) or other suitable Ability,
              when turned into an Effect, may at the player’s choice influence anybody
              witnessing the art emotionally, akin to how MUSIC (I) would. The target may
              resist the influence with RESIST (R) against the Effect value. Cost: 1 REASON
              per check forced.
            %dt Knockback
            %dd
              The character may send others flying with his powerful blows. In extended
              conflict this can end the conflict if the player’s check was the highest of all
              during a round; such a conflict ends without resolving the stakes, making for
              an opportunity to back off. Cost: 2 VIGOR
            %dt Language (specify)
            %dd
              The character knows an extra language in addition to his own. If no character
              in the campaign has this Secret, then it’s up to the Story Guide to decide how
              much pain in the ass he wants language to be, case-by-case.
            %dt Luck
            %dd
              When the character gets GIFT DICE from others, the player gains an equal
              number of dice into his own Gift Pool to redistribute. Even if the group is not
              using Gift Dice, other players can still each give one Gift Die to this
              character to any checks they want.
            %dt Mighty Blow
            %dd
              When the character deals injury to another by violence, the player may choose
              to increase the level of Harm caused by paying VIGOR: 1 point per one level of
              increase. The maximum level of Harm is MORTAL (6), however. Cost: 1+ VIGOR
            %dt Past
            %dd
              The character has a rich and meaningful past. Whenever this backstory comes up
              in play, the player may choose to frame a flashback scene revealing a part of
              it. Play the scene as cut scene if appropriate. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
            %dt Prophecy
            %dd
              The character gets prophetic flashes. Either the player or the Story Guide may
              activate this Secret to have the player make a PRAY (V) check; the player may
              call for his character to RESIST (R) the vision, however. Success indicates
              important visions of the future or far away places, narrated by the player who
              called for the prophecy. The check result may be made into an Effect by anybody
              the prophecy pertains to (whether present or not); anybody who hears of the
              prophecy can duplicate the Effect by paying for it, making it viral. The
              prophetic Effect provides bonus dice normally, and may also be used for penalty
              dice on pertinent opposing checks. Cost: 1 VIGOR
            %dt Prophecy #2
            %dd
              The player can make a PRAY (V) check to get a look at the Key Elements list in
              advance. The Story Guide shows him as many Key Elements as the level of his
              check indicates. Cost: 1 VIGOR
            %dt Quest (specify)
            %dd
              The character has a treasure map, plan or other precepts for achieving a major
              goal, which probably involves gaining some rare Secret or Key or such. This
              Secret is replaced with the target Secret after three successful conflicts
              towards the goal: the Story Guide includes the quest in the stakes of
              appropriate conflicts. He also determines whether losing the conflict risks the
              whole plan or not.
            %dt Retrain (Ability, Pool)
            %dd
              The character has undergone some special training or exotic conditions related
              to the Ability in question. For example, he might practice a Reason-based
              musical style taught in old Maldorian art academies. The Ability is now
              associated with both its original Pool and a new Pool. The two Pools have
              separate point spend limits for this Ability. The player may also rename the
              Ability at this point to reflect the changing emphasis; this might be useful in
              moving between cultures that have similar but separate Abilities, for example.
            %dt Scribing (specify)
            %dd
              The character knows how to read and write in one writing system. If no
              character in the campaign has this Secret, then it’s up to the Story Guide to
              decide how much pain in the ass he wants literacy to be, case-bycase.
            %dt Shrew
            %dd
              The character is skilled at tugging at the heart-strings of others with their
              manipulation. The player may opt to spend a successful social Ability check
              result as penalty dice against the target character if the target opts to act
              against the advice given by the shrew. This works even for social Effects
              created in earlier scenes. The shrew does not have to be present to spend the
              dice, as long as the target remembers their earlier interaction.
            %dt Sidekick (person)
            %dd
              Choose an amiable secondary character that has no Abilities higher than the
              character’s highest. The secondary character is now assumed to stick with the
              player character and help him out of loyalty to common motives, payment or
              other suitable motive. The sidekick follows instructions for the most part; the
              Story Guide may contest individual commands with a RESIST (R) check. The
              secondary character has KEY OF SERVANT for free, but may not use any other
              Keys; the player character may not gain experience due to interaction with his
              sidekick. Should the sidekick decide to leave, he decides whether the master
              gains back the Advance spent on this Secret.
            %dt Specialty (focus)
            %dd
              The character has focused his skills to a specific direction. Choose a
              specialty that is narrower than an Ability. The character gains a free bonus
              die to any Ability check made within the specialty.
            %dt Sudden Knife
            %dd
              The character is practiced as a killer. When the player activates this Secret
              in a violent conflict, death for the losing party becomes a part of the stakes.
              Either party may voluntarily de-escalate, but as long as the assassin continues
              to seek death, he gains a boon: for each ‘ ‘ overflow die in his Ability check,
              he causes a penalty die for his target’s check (opposed checks only in extended
              conflict). Cost: 3 from the Pool associated with the current conflict Ability,
              1 from each other Pool.
            %dt Synergy (Ability, Ability)
            %dd
              The character has learned to combine the two Abilities seamlessly in
              situations that utilize both. The character may use either Ability to support
              the other in extended conflict as a normal support chain that does not expend a
              round. In normal conflicts check both Abilities simultaneously and have the
              worse check support the better, regardless of other conditions.
            %dt Vagabond
            %dd
              The character has lived among different cultures through his life. For each
              time the player takes this Secret he may add one background culture for his
              character, allowing him to use crunch from several cultures in character
              creation and later development. The cultures have to border each other
              geographically or be otherwise connected. (Note that characters can gain crunch
              from other cultures without this Secret in play. The Secret just formalizes the
              fact that the character has spent a long while with a culture and can improvise
              crunch from it like he were native.)

      %a#keys-heroic-urges{:name => "keys-heroic-urges"} Keys: Heroic Urges
    %p
      In an epic fantasy setting like Near Keys are “heroic urges” – it’s easy to
      interpret Keys as expressions of the greater nature of a given protagonist
      character. Of course TSoY is also a quintessentially humane setting; all people
      are worthy of respect, and protagonists become heroes due to their
      circumstances and experiences, not due to fate alone. I won’t bore the reader
      with my patented anti-fascist fantasy lecture here, it suffices to say that I
      love playing stories of Near that are about human concerns big and small. If
      heroism should happen, it comes about due to choices made by the characters and
      not due to rigorous narrative whitewashing.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#new-keys{:name => "new-keys"} New Keys
      %p
        I’ve always created new Keys as needed for the dramatic sensibilities of the
        group. I would probably read the Keys in this book as important examples and
        likely candidates, not as a limiting constraint. There is no pressure to create
        your own Keys, of course – the general list alone is more than sufficient for
        many different characters.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#keys-for-secondary-characters{:name => "keys-for-secondary-characters"} Keys for secondary characters
      %p
        I don’t usually bother with Keys for secondary characters per se in TSoY;
        instead, I assume that all named secondary characters have a Key concerning
        their foremost passion of the moment, should that become pertinent.
      %p
        Secondary characters in my TSoY only really advance in experience with
        fictional events and time. So something has to happen in the fiction for the
        character’s capabilities to change, and the Story Guide judges what the change
        brings. Sidekicks and such are an exception; if a player runs the statistics of
        a given character, then the player may as well track experience points for
        them.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#useless-keys{:name => "useless-keys"} Useless Keys
      %p
        Keys in TSoY tend to be quite quirky by generic SOLAR SYSTEM standards. It’s
        not that hard to make a Key completely useless without hitting the Buyoff
        condition with some of these, especially when characters can change the world.
        I handle those situations by allowing the character to regain an Advance for
        the useless Key, provided that it has really become non-applicable and not just
        difficult to use.

        %dl.docutils
          %dt Adventure
          %dd
            For the people of Near, adventure means refusing social ties; most societies
            frown upon this, but not all. Some have approved roles for people eager for
            adventure. 1xp: Go on or continue an adventure when you could back down. 2xp:
            Get into danger. 5xp: Do the impossible. Buyoff: Settle down.
          %dt Bloodlust
          %dd
            The character enjoys defeating others in combat. This Key is considered a
            virtue in almost all cultures of Near, but only when practiced in the correct
            ways by the right people. 1xp: Attack somebody. 3xp: Win a fight. Buyoff: Be
            defeated in battle.
          %dt Compassion
          %dd
            The character struggles to do right by others. Foolish sympathy is not rated
            very highly by most cultures of Near, but it exists in all. The emblematic
            scene that separates the hero from the villain comes when the former’s
            compassion gets abused by the latter. 1xp: Help those in need. 2xp: Save
            another’s life. 5xp: Get taken advantage of. Buyoff: Ignore the cries of the
            innocent.
          %dt Coward
          %dd
            The character frightens easily and can’t or won’t control it in public. The
            Key is the same whether prudence is accepted of the character socially or not.
            1xp: Show your fear to others. 3xp: Back down from a confrontation. Buyoff:
            Risk yourself voluntarily.
          %dt Cripple
          %dd
            The character is crippled or has some such permanent injury. Old age,
            blindness and lameness are fine examples. 1xp: Get pitied or scorned for your
            condition. 2xp: Suffer difficulties due to the condition. 5xp: Succeed despite
            your condition. Buyoff: Get healed of your infirmity.
          %dt Desperation
          %dd
            The character has given up hope. Broken souls are not at all rare in Near of
            today. Some of them may never heal. 1xp: Try to convince others to give up.
            3xp: Give up on something important. Buyoff: Cast aside your despair.
          %dt Faith (specify)
          %dd
            The character has a belief system that guides him. Not all cultures have
            churches, but most have religions of some sort. 1xp: The faith comes up. 2xp:
            Enact the faith in action. 5xp: Suffer for your faith. Buyoff: Abandon and deny
            your faith.
          %dt Fellowship
          %dd
            The character belongs in a fraternity of unlikely allies questing for a common
            goal. Such a bond can be the strongest of them all. 1xp: Discuss the course of
            the fellowship with the other members. 2xp: Cooperate with the fellowship to
            achieve your goals. 5xp: Side with the fellowship against your own best
            interests. Buyoff: Leave the fellowship.
          %dt Glittering Gold
          %dd
            Avarice runs in his veins. As with most character traits, a majority of
            societies considers a modicum in this regard a virtue, with a minority favoring
            extremes to either direction. 1xp: Gain material wealth. 3xp: Gain wealth at
            the expense of others. Buyoff: Give away your wealth.
          %dt Glory
          %dd
            The character hungers for renown. This is typical for heroes who don’t want to
            be seen as just a face in the crowd. 1xp: Make sure your name and deeds are
            known by bragging or seeking witnesses. 3xp: Take foolish risks to increase or
            enjoy your fame. Buyoff: Give the credit that would have increased your glory
            to someone else.
          %dt Impostor
          %dd
            The character lives in and for lies. Perhaps he is proud of his ability to
            introduce and control illusions into the lives of people he uses as tools. 1xp:
            Pass yourself off as something you’re not. 2xp: Lie to yourself or your
            friends. 5xp: Your lie survives a concerned effort to debunk it. Buyoff:
            Confess to your victims.
          %dt Mission (specify)
          %dd
            The character has an important mission that they must complete. Unlike the KEY
            OF THE VOW, this Key concerns a clear task with a finite end-point. 1xp: Try to
            forward your mission. 2xp: Succeed towards your mission. 5xp: Reach an
            important waypoint. Buyoff: Abandon the mission.
          %dt Outcast (specify)
          %dd
            The character has lost fellowship in a group or organization, becoming an
            outcast. This has not necessarily lessened the hold the organization’s values
            have on the character. 1xp: Your status as outcast comes up. 2xp: Interact with
            the organization. 5xp: Work against the organization. Buyoff: Rejoin the
            organization.
          %dt Past
          %dd
            The character has a dark, significant past. 1xp: Your past comes up. 3xp: Your
            past influences a decision. Buyoff: Make a different choice this time.
          %dt Power
          %dd
            The character hungers for control, perhaps because he’s had so little of it.
            1xp: Struggle for influence. 3xp: Improve your social position. Buyoff:
            Relinquish your position.
          %dt Relation (specify)
          %dd
            The character has an important relationship to another. Familial relationships

    %p
      “Equipment” in the SOLAR SYSTEM is a somewhat flexible term: not only tools and
      gear, but also masses of people, vehicles and natural weapons have been
      considered equipment. The dramatic significance of equipment in the fiction is
      its external nature to the character himself; we’ve chosen to emphasize this by
      giving equipment separate, distinctive rules. They can be used to emphasize
      realistic considerations (“having a sword against an unarmed man is a big
      deal”) or for purely dramatic purposes (“this particular sword symbolizes
      kingship, therefore it has mechanical impact”), as desired.
    %p
      Equipment more than most other rules has a somewhat problematic history in
      TSoY. The original equipment rules of the game have not interacted too well
      with my own play: at first I spent a couple of years outright misplaying
      against the intent of the rules, and when I corrected my understanding, it
      proved that the rules didn’t fit the bonus dice heavy crunch environment at my
      table.
    %p
      My intent with these new rules was to build them to be essentially compatible
      with the old ones, to make it easier for individual groups to pick and choose
      their own preferred approach.

        %a#basics-of-equipment{:name => "basics-of-equipment"} Basics of Equipment
      %p
        When a character has an important tool, such as a signature weapon, the player
        may choose to have it emphasized via the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT. The Solar System
        rules for DECLARED equipment may also be used if desired.
      %p
        Each piece of equipment has a QUALITY VALUE as an Effect; this is derived with
        a Barter (I) or suitable crafting Ability check, depending on how the character
        came by the equipment. The quality is important when another character is
        trying to destroy the equipment, and it sets the upper limit for the
        equipment’s usefulness in other ways as well.
      %p
        The two main mechanics for a piece of equipment are EQUIPMENT RATINGS and
        IMBUEMENTS. A given piece of equipment will usually have equipment ratings
        equal to its quality rating; it may also have at most that many imbuements.
        However, each imbuement increases the INTRODUCTION COST of the equipment, so
        having them is not always a good thing.
      .section

          %a#mundane-vs-magical-equipment{:name => "mundane-vs-magical-equipment"} Mundane vs. Magical Equipment
        %p
          This has not been so much of an issue in other settings, but in TSoY I seem to
          constantly bump on the matter of unrealistic equipment: a character might have
          a comb that helps him attract horses, or some such unlikely combination. The
          fantastic environment seems to encourage this, as in fact it is perfectly
          possible to have such a comb in this game.
        %p
          The way I deal with this is to be clear on whether equipment and its ratings
          are mundane or “magical”, and judge accordingly. It’s perfectly reasonable for
          a character to buy a horse that helps him move faster, but buying a horse that
          helps him write letters would take a bit more doing, because normally I would
          assume that such horses weren’t for sale in most places.
        %p
          Mundanity is judged mostly by the Story Guide. Usually it comes up when a
          perfectly ordinary smith wants to create some strange and wonderful device.
          That’s when I get to consider whether such a creation really is possible
          without Elven magic or some such source of supernatural mojo. Some groups will
          specifically want to make fantastic equipment easy to create, so do by all
          means draw the line between mundane and magical as you see fit.

          Some crunch only applies to equipment used in different ways. These are not
          classifications of equipment itself, but of how it is used. A TOOL is any
          equipment not used against an opponent. A WEAPON is an equipment used
          offensively to affect an opponent, while an ARMOR is used to protect oneself.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#rated-equipment{:name => "rated-equipment"} Rated Equipment
      %p
        The equipment rating is a value in the range +1–3, combined with a short phrase
        describing where it might be applicable.
      %p
        For example, a simple sword might have an equipment rating “+1 to injure men or
        beasts”. This sword would then be applicable when the character using it tried
        to injure men or beasts with it.
      %p
        Each equipment rating is associated with a different scope of effect: higher
        ratings come only from more specialized equipment, like so:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt +1 rating
        %dd
          applies to certain sorts of activity, with the scope roughly similar to an
          Ability. Examples:
      %p
      %ul.simple
        %li A telescope for a +1 when examining distant things.
        %li The Book of Light for a +1 when convincing people.
        %li A horse for a +1 when traveling overland.
      %p
      %dl.docutils
        %dt +2 rating
        %dd
          only applies in specific circumstances, akin in scope to the SECRET OF
          SPECIALTY. Examples:
      %p
      %ul.simple
        %li A firebomb for +2 at burning a thing.
        %li An Ammeni perfume for a +2 in convincing people attracted to you.
        %li Snowshoes for a +2 when traveling over snow and ice.
      %dl.docutils
        %dt +3 rating
        %dd
          applies in very specific circumstances that rarely come up of their own
          accord. Examples:
      %p
      %ul.simple
        %li A helmet for a +3 against head-blows.
        %li A royal charter for a +3 when convincing people to go along with it.
        %li A shallow boat for a +3 when traveling in the Zaru marshes.
      %p
      %p Each equipment may have at most three +1 ratings, two +2 ratings and one +3 rating, provided the equipment quality suffices. Most likely these ratings overlap in one piece of equipment, providing increasing specialties within a single field of endeavor, but that is not mandatory.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#using-equipment-ratings{:name => "using-equipment-ratings"} Using Equipment Ratings
        %p
          Despite being a bit lengthy thing to explain, equipment ratings are useful
          because they can be hooked into other crunch to provide different effects. They
          also have one basic use that is available to anybody with an equipment rating
          at hand: should the character make an Ability check in a situation where the
          rating applies, the player may opt to replace the check result with the value
          of the equipment rating. The dice roll simply doesn’t apply, although it is
          rolled normally. The only cost of this is that if the check would have been a
          FAILURE (0) without the equipment, then the equipment’s quality quality drops
          by one.
        %p
          To make this unequivocal: the equipment rating replaces the result of the
          check, and does not care about the character’s Ability level. It’s not far off
          to say that the character is withdrawing from the conflict and letting his
          equipment do the struggling, whereas he merely makes an Ability check to see if
          he can keep the equipment from breaking.

          The default effect of equipment ratings isn’t cumulative, but if a character
          has some crunch that makes several pieces of equipment sensible, then I allow
          each individual piece of equipment to be used once per check as long as the
          action makes sense in the fiction. The Story Guide might wish to lean on
          traditional fantasy RPG aesthetics in this, with single-handed and two-handed
          weapons, shields and such.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#imbued-equipment{:name => "imbued-equipment"} Imbued Equipment
      %p
        IMBUED items are a lateral depiction of equipment. They are items with
        integrated Secrets in them that a character can use through the item.
        Imbuements are useful in depicting not only wacky magic items that do stuff for
        you, but also for mundane equipment that does more than just improves Ability
        checks. A character might, for example, have a heavy mace with the SECRET OF
        KNOCKBACK inherent to it, to coin a mundane example.
      %p
        Existence of Imbuements does not increase the Advance cost to own an item;
        instead, an imbued item has an INTRODUCTION cost: first time the item is used
        for anything in a single scene, the player has to pay a Pool cost equal to the
        number of imbuements it has. This goes even if the item is just used for its
        ratings; the presence of imbuements makes taking the item out a weighty matter.
      %p
        Which Pools the imbued item drains is established by the Story Guide when the
        item is introduced; the profile remains unchanged after that. Be colorful about
        it: heavy anime weapons take Vigor, items with many parts take Reason, that
        sort of thing. An item’s quality rating sets the maximum number of imbuements
        an item may have.
      %p
        Although the imbued Secret is used just like it would if the character himself
        possessed it, Pool costs and all, in the fiction it is usually not the “same”
        Secret that people use. Thus imbued Secrets don’t care about fulfilling
        requirements, can’t be used to learn the original Secret and so on. When I
        particularly want to emphasize that I’m not talking about a natural Secret that
        characters learn, I call imbued Secrets IMBUEMENTS. So an imbued mace doesn’t
        strictly speaking have the SECRET OF KNOCKBACK, it has KNOCKBACK IMBUEMENT. One
        other difference between Imbuements and Secrets is that the former are usually
        somewhat narrower in application: the character has to use the item in question
        to activate the Imbuement, for example, while the Secret version can be used in
        any situation.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#gaining-equipment{:name => "gaining-equipment"} Gaining Equipment
      %p
        The simplest method for gaining equipment is to DECLARE it. Aside from Story
        Guide decision á la SOLAR SYSTEM, players may purchase the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT
        all but instantly by deciding that a character’s horse or armor or hat is
        important enough to pay an Advance for. Most Story Guides seem to be fine with
        this; I myself used to be hardass and demand a character to go buy or steal or
        otherwise gain a piece of equipment interesting enough for this, but nowadays
        I’ve come around: if equipment has been established as existing in the fiction
        and it’s not in the middle of a conflict, it’s the player’s decision where he
        wants to spend his Advances.
      %p
        When the SECRET OF EQUIPMENT is spontaneously declared like this, have the
        player make a suitable Ability check to represent the quality of the item, in
        case such a check hasn’t already been made. If no pertinent Ability jumps out,
        the Story Guide may well decide the quality of the item freely: the item would
        probably be between MARGINAL (1) and GREAT (3), but it’s the Story Guide’s
        call. The equipment ratings for garnered equipment are determined by having the
        player first pick one equipment rating, after which the Story Guide names the
        others based on his sensibilities. Declared equipment is always “mundane” in
        the aforementioned sense, I’d expect.

          Rated and/or imbued equipment costs an Advance to own. It is not uncommon for
          characters to go to Advance debt with suddenly garnered equipment while they
          gather experience to learn to use it properly.
        %p
          Losing equipment allows a character to regain the Advance invested in it. This
          goes for gifts as well: giving a piece of equipment to another regains an
          Advance for the giver, while the receiver has to invest an Advance.

          above. There are also Secrets that make the process more efficient, such as the
          SECRET OF CREATION. Imbued items are complex enough that I don’t usually allow
          creating them by declaration at all, unless the imbuement makes very much
          sense.

        %h4
          %a#disarming-and-destroying-equipment{:name => "disarming-and-destroying-equipment"} Disarming and destroying equipment
        %p
          Whether a character can use a piece of equipment depends on the fictional
          situation, so one way to prevent it is to disarm him with suitable action.
          Also, the equipment may be outright destroyed just like if it was an Effect; an
          Ability check against the quality of the item suffices.
        %p
          Equipment that loses in quality also loses equipment ratings, and might lose
          imbuements if the quality drops low enough. The user of the equipment chooses
          which ratings and imbuements are lost. The ratings can be regained by repairing
          the equipment with a suitable check; the imbuements only come back in repair if
          that seems to make sense in the fiction; otherwise they need to be recreated
          from scratch.

              provides a discount to its introduction cost with a CAVALRY (V) check. It can

              associates INSTINCT with CAVALRY (V), perhaps due to its northern stock.

          propriety. When the character dies, the player gets to narrate how one part of
          Near fails; might be right here, might be far away, but something was depending
          on him. A part of the setting is now dead. Treat this as a transcendence
          narration insofar as the rest of the campaign is concerned. Requirement: only
          at character creation.

          The character refuses to let go, preferring to continue in the campaign: when
          the character makes a TRANSCENDENT (7) level success in an Ability check, the
          player may opt to roll additional penalty dice into the check before accepting
          the result, thus potentially lowering it from TRANSCENDENT. Cost: 1st level
          Harm per penalty die. Requirement: at least one Ability at GRAND MASTER (4).

      It has been 300 years since the SKYFIRE, a catastrophe that decimated the
      world. A giant asteroid ripped into the planet, forcing a part of it to
      separate into a large moon. Only luck and large mountain chains saved Near from
      the shockwave that obliterated most of the world. It still remains to be seen
      whether the broken world can sustain life indefinitely or whether the biosphere
      is doomed to perish as the atmosphere leaks into space or the continental
      plates realign catastrophically.
    %p
      Although the lands known as Near were largely protected from the immediate
      impact, the Year of Shadow that immediately followed decimated the agriculture,
      leading to nine tenths of the population perishing. The remaining people
      struggle with a lost culture and changed world, surviving at a subsistence
      level.
    %p
      Or that’s the pessimistic vision, anyway. In practice Near is a huge
      contradiction in play – I for one haven’t ever gone full-blown survivalist with
      this game, no matter how much TSoY flirts with realism mixed in with the
      fantasy. Just this last spring I started a new campaign, and the world
      certainly resembled nothing so much as the early medieval dark ages, complete
      with specialized service industries and money. This was simply what our group
      needed, we had no patience for exploring the implications of primitivism when
      our focus was on the clash of patriarchal society with wiccan theology.
    %p
      As you come to read this book, you’ll notice that it is full of contradictions
      like this. Near is only consistent in play, not in a book. The group is
      expected to pare down and creatively ignore anything that doesn’t fit their
      campaign, as well as invent answers for any open questions they encounter.

        Near is shadowed by the ROOF OF THE WORLD, a large mountain chain to the west.
        Everything falls into the great Eastern Sea on the other edge of the world. In
        between was the Empire of Maldor, the greatest civilization Near had ever
        known.

        As the Skyfire broke the world, many changes happened: new mountains rose,
        valleys fell into sea and the sky itself occluded, darkened by great clouds of
        dust. The Sea of Teeth ripped into the Northern part of Near, drowning much and
        separating the rest.
      %p
        Life in Near is for most people a constant struggle. The great majority of the
        people live in preliterate barter economies. The difference between cultures
        that survived the Year of Shadow as primitive hunter-gatherers and those that
        stockpiled technology into elaborate shelters is striking. It is now anybody’s
        guess as to how the world will shake out in the end.

        The Moon is a terrible curse for those who cling to the values and ways of the
        past. For those who look to the future and change it becomes a symbol of
        rebirth. Often actual history has little say in where the battle-lines form:
        politics unanimously condemned by the Empire might be defended by invoking that
        very name, while ethics cherished then are being reintroduced as a new thing,
        with the Moon embroidered on the battle flag.

        A couple of words on this whole Skyfire thing and the Near in general; why is
        this historical back-story material useful in practice?
      %p
        Most campaigns do not concern themselves directly with the Year of Shadow or
        the Skyfire, or in fact any old myths I might choose to include between these
        covers. Your typical campaign tells the stories of individual people who
        sometimes rise to change their own society into something better. For most
        purposes you can just file this Skyfire thing in the bottom drawer and
        concentrate on the now: these fictional people in this fictional situation.
      %p
        Regardless, the Skyfire and the coming of the Moon are a common strand that
        ties together the stories of Near. The world is young and raw after the
        catastrophe, but the shadow of the past presses down on it; there’s lots of
        high-level thematic stuff in heroes who rebuild the world and need to choose
        between the past and the unknown future. The Story Guide or anybody interested
        in setting backstory can use this stuff to make sense of things for himself.
      %p
        One thing I like to play with here is the symbolism of what the actions of
        player characters actually mean for the world: just like the characters are
        struggling to find their place in society, so is the world itself trying to
        find an equilibrium. It’s completely arbitrary, but I like to think that should
        the heroes fail in their own passion (whatever it may be), perhaps that doesn’t
        bode well for the whole world, either: as the days get longer and the Moon
        grows larger, this failed world goes into tidal lock and dies out of the last
        convulsion it was given by cruel fate.
      %p
        Then again, heroic deeds go with the genre, so great successes are also
        narrated. The astronomy of Near is in shambles after the Moon appeared, the
        celestial objects themselves are still adjusting. Whenever a hero transcends
        (TRANSCENDENT success in an Ability check, you know) in Near, an eclipse
        blackens the sky for an hour, day or night. Perhaps it is a sign of hope for
        the people.

      Across the deep waters of Absolon's Way lie the ruins of Maldor, once the
      grandest empire Near has ever known. Before the Shadow Moon came, Maldor ruled
      the world, its empire spreading from the Eastern Sea to the frozen waters of
      the South and the Hungry River of the north. Maldor's most distinctive feature
      was its tremendous walled cities, giant sealed engines of industry and culture.
      As the empire fell and shrunk back to the center of Near, many of its cities
      were ruined as terror and plague eradicated their denizens. These cities,
      filled with secrets and danger, are a destination for especially foolish or
      brave adventurers.
    %p
      Today the land is much different; the old ways of the Empire have given way to
      brazen robber barons and failed principalities that can just barely protect
      their Lords, leaving the peasantry and negligible citizenry to fight for the
      scraps.
    %p
      Maldor is made up of a variety of geography, from rolling plains stretching to
      the ocean in the east to forest-covered hills in the west. It once was
      beautiful. It now looks like someone dropped a bomb on the cover of a
      sad-eyed-wizard fantasy novel.

        When the Sky Fire fell, Emperor Absolon passed on and Maldor passed into
        darkness. As people took to the land again, the country found itself shattered,
        with local lords claiming royal blood dividing the land up like lions on a
        carcass: unfair and bloody. The disparity between the wealthy and poor is
        immense; only those families with great stone fortresses and great stores were
        able to emerge as anything but destitute.
      %p
        The Lords of the land press commoners into service as infantry, farmers,
        artisans, or whatever suits their whims. Outright war between these Lords is
        not uncommon as they attempt to gain dominance over each other. None have
        achieved their goal, however, and the country remains divided.
      %p
        The Maldorites are war-weary, blindly attempting to follow their old ways of
        life. The people are a mix of ethnicities, although the noble lines are all
        Caucasoid in appearance. Nobility treasures their blood and the peasants huddle
        together, but families are often separated by war, hunger, and wanderlust.

        Maldor is in its dark ages; the old Civil Service wilted soon after the
        academies closed down, with the remaining officials turning their talents of
        lore and wizardry to the service of the Lords in an effort of survival,
        becoming courtiers. The noble courts are now the primary centers of learning in
        Maldor. Sciences, history and the arts of wizardry are transmitted by masters
        to their disciples individually, as they will and care.
      %p
        Art and culture take second-place to survival. Among the noble classes, art
        still exists in collections from before the Shadow Moon came. Tapestries,
        painting, and sculpture are most prized. Artists are employed by lords, but
        innovation is rare: the artists are called on to make knock-offs of preShadow
        art more than anything else. Musicians and actors do well if they can find a
        liege, as owning the better court entertainment is a major point of pride for
        these cardboard nobles playing at being kings.

        Other troubadours wander the countryside, going from inn to inn to make a few

        mercenaries to pillage a fallen city and is now printing books using a press
        they managed to liberate. From the borderlands, there are stories of commoners
        banding together to rebuild villages; these communes are said to sponsor
        community theatres of dubious quality, but high humor.

        The Maldorian economy can be described as an ever hungry violent monster,
        constantly devouring itself to live. Farmers grow grain, corn, potatoes, and
        other root vegetables and raise goats, sheep, and cattle for milk and food, but
        it never seems to be enough, especially as the Lords take an obscene amount of
        crops and livestock in land taxes to pay for their wars. Beer and vodka make up
        a large amount of their exports, especially to the Gorenite highlands. Metal is
        found in the western hills, and what doesn't become an axe or breastplate gets
        sold to the iron-poor north. Most families have to supplement their income by
        taking up the sword. The nobles promise good pay in their armies, although
        plenty of young people end up dying on the end of a sword before payday.
      %p
        Individual lords of Maldor supplement their coffers by trading priceless
        artifacts and antiquities to foreigners. The Ammenite Houses are the major
        buyers of these objects. There is good pay in Maldor for a seasoned explorer;
        the ruins of many great cities are filled with arms and art, as well as fierce
        ratkin unlikely to appreciate pillagers.

        Maldor is the linchpin of TSoY in that it holds the Shadow of Yesterday: the
        past is everywhere in sight and its weight oppresses the land every day. A game
        set in Maldor will not necessarily go all revolutionary, however; characters
        may well end up championing the feudal obligations, transforming the shallow
        rule of warlords into a real social contract between the rulers and the ruled.
        I try to reflect this in the crunch, which provides some
        functional-but-not-quite means for upholding a society in an essentially
        lawless, feudal context.

        Maldor also has a function as the point of relation between the fantasy genre
        and Near; this is why I start the book with it. Basically Maldor is your normal

          %a#the-gender-issue{:name => "the-gender-issue"} The Gender Issue
        %p
          Maldorian society is traditionally chauvinistic, which means more for the upper
          classes and less for the lower. It’s become pretty typical in fantasy
          roleplaying through recent years to actively ignore this facet of medievalism
          in favor of gender transparency, which is something you can easily do here as
          well for player characters (or everybody) if you want; however, I suggest
          considering the opposite tack as well: if you want to play a woman of Maldor,
          is it not an important part of her identity that she has to deal with these
          issues in her life?
        %p
          My own first instinct would be to simply play a male character if I wanted to
          avoid dealing with this (admittedly well-worn, at least here in my own play
          environment) issue. Another important point is that at least in my experience
          bad play around gender has often resulted from disabling play as opposed to
          enabling; the Story Guide shouldn’t simply use gender as a sadistic hammer for
          harassing some players.
        %p
          In practice: if you are Story Guiding for female characters and feel like
          forbidding the character from leaving her home or speaking in public, consider
          the situation as a genuine choice for the player, not a prerequisite for play;
          should they choose to have her rebel, respect the character’s right to try to
          change her circumstances or even the world.

        The diminishing middle class of imperial Maldor is represented today by
        courtiers and craftsmen. When the common people are concerned only with
        survival and the Lords only with war, the cultural heritage of the land and the
        world is in their hands.
      %p
        Freedom is at a premium in the lawless Maldor. Even the nobility is constrained
        in their lives by the expectations of their peers and vassals, and by the
        necessities of war. The game is played for the highest stakes of all, but it is
        far from certain whether participating in it is worth the sacrifice, morally
        right or even humane. Getting out might cost even more, however, because your
        family is just as committed as you are.
      %p
        Maldorian peasants as player characters seem to usually be either vagrants,
        rebels or not peasants for long; the social framework of Maldor is such that it
        doesn’t make for much of a drama to accept this lot in life. If the player
        character doesn’t want to leave and doesn’t want to change the system, the
        Story Guide does well to proffer him a chance at social betterment through the
        court or battlefield.
      %p
        Rebellions discontent with the rule of particular Lords mingle freely with
        proper revolutions that strive to start new societies afresh. Reformation
        towards the society of the old Empire is far from unknown as well in the
        central areas that still remember. I don’t hesitate to mix modernistic, utopian
        and high philosophical ideas into the social movements that roll through the
        Maldorian countryside. There is no one revolution, but many.

      The people of Near were traumatized and broken by the Skyfire. The original
      Empire of Maldor was defined by solar worship, reaching its height in the image
      of Absolon Sun-Emperor, the champion of Sun in Near, worthy of worship in
      himself. When the Moon rose for the first time and eclipsed the Sun, it became
      an object of veneration and fear in one stroke.

      Now the Sun and the Moon struggle for domination in the lands of Near, but
      nowhere is the competition more bloodier than in Maldor, the broken empire.

      %p
        The lords of Maldor are monotheistic. Their religion centers around a variation
        of ancient sun god worship: they have melded the figure of the sun god and
        Absolon, saying that the Year of Shadow was Absolon's sacrifice as he descended
        into the underworld, then rose again, undefeated by Shadow. Their priests
        prophesy his return to Near as a king that will re-unite Maldor and make it
        strong again. Some philosophers might debate about when Absolon will come
        again, but the lords do not: there's not a one of them without the hubris to
        think that he is Absolon-Come-again, and that all will bow down to him. This
        messiah complex makes their wars all the more bloody, of course.
      %p
        The original empire of Maldor was defined by its worship of the sun as deity.
        The sun gave light and life to all things and was venerated as such. The
        original worship was personal and communal in nature; small invocations were
        given before a meal, for example. As the empire grew, worship was formalized
        and gave birth to a priestly class. The Emperor Absolon was designated the
        sun's champion on Near, and became an object of worship himself. The trappings
        of sun worship can still be found in Maldor, including broken churches, usually
        designed with no roof and a structure that was aligned with sunrise and sunset.
      %p
        Monotheism trickles down to the peasants, who tend to worship the sun god in
        its more pagan aspect, as a giver of life and blessing. Unlike the lords, the
        peasants definitely argue about when Absolon will return: their dream of a
        better day is well-deserved, but pathetic. As Maldor was once a great
        multicultural cornucopia, though, religion varies widely among its lower
        classes, which practice animism, ancestor worship, or any variety of other
        religious practices in addition to sun-worship.

          Many Lords of Maldor declare openly that they and nobody else are
          Absolon-Come-Again. This is evident in their titles, which have themes of the
          sun. Charles of the Zenith and Philippe the Dawn-Breaker are two examples.
          State worship is often enforced by blade and taxes are taken directly from the
          collections of these new churches. Their priests are as much political and
          military leaders as clergy.
        %p
          The proletariat has not completely bought into these new myths and has reverted
          to the primitive personal rites for true worship, although they participate in
          the state worship. Rustic sun pastors travel across the land, poor in coin but
          not in spirit, ministering to those that need them, preaching of a time when
          the true Sun Emperor will rise again.

        Rumors of a Shadow Cult abound, evildoers who would try to throw down the sun
        and replace it with their dark Queen of Shadow. It is unknown who exactly the
        Shadow Cult is. Earls and dukes tell their people that the Shadow Cult are the
        followers of other earls and dukes; advisors tell their lords that the Shadow
        Cult grows among their own people; commoners believe the Shadow Cult are the
        ratkin, or nasty elves, or their next-door neighbors, depending on what day of
        the week it is. Some elements have been assassinating self-proclaimed messiahs
        and blowing up castle walls without getting caught, but leave no clue as to
        whom they are.
      %p
        The reality of the Shadow Cult is that it has no leaders and it revels in
        plurality. Whether this anarchy turns into discord as the Sun Lords weaken
        remains to be seen – for now there is well enough room for witches, ratkin,
        revolutionaries, reformers and even republicans in the ranks of the movement.
        The theology of the Shadow Cult is vague, but generally it deals with ending
        the rule of man, celebrating the human body and justifying acts of violence
        against the Sun Lords. The cult practices witchcraft, but not everybody agrees
        that the Queen of Shadow is actually the tri-partite Goddess of old.
        Regardless, the Queen responds to her witches who raise the Aspect of the Moon.
      %p
        Women join the cult for protection and power. Ratkin join the Cult because it
        teaches that the fanged ones are children of the new Goddess. Men join the cult
        for the free sex. Lords join for the poisonous gifts offered against their
        enemies. The cult ceremonies accept all, although some new recruits might find
        themselves under the knives of the less compassionate priestesses of the Moon.

      %p
        The last era of the Empire was a time of great breakthroughs. It was then that
        the eye of man was cast at the heavens. The royal astronomers with their
        telescopes discovered new stars that moved like no other. With time their
        secret was deciphered: like the Emperor was orbited by servants in running the
        empire, so was the Sun Lord himself orbited by these eight planets, Servitors
        of the Sun. What transformed the understanding of the sages, however, was this:
        Near was one of these Servitors.
      %p
        Now much of this knowledge is lost, but legends still remember the names of the
        Servitors:
      %ul.simple
        %li ABRAMOV, Judge of Fire
        %li PHOLUS, Sky Navigator
        %li NEAR, Royal Doctor
        %li KIEV, Star General

        %li GWANGJU, Court Magician
        %li SIJJIN, Renegade Repentant
        %li ENCHIRIDION, Mysterious Confidant
        %li FAR, Trusted Stranger
      %p
        The litany of names is revered by courtiers, what remains of the Civil Service
        of Antiquity. The Servitors are a resonant idea, suggesting a celestial order
        that refutes stark monotheism. They get no worship, however, for they are only
        remembered by men too civilized for gods. Even where the commoners know the
        stories, they cannot see the stars: the sky has grown more opaque after the
        Year of Darkness, with only the light of the most powerful stars shining
        through.
      %p
        Still, in a time of chaos, many courtiers rely on the litany for their dignity
        and role in the drab, martial courts of the present Lords. It is not a faith on
        the unseen gods so much as a faith on the tradition and propriety that allows
        the courtier courage to rise even against his Lord at times to demand and
        receive the proper respect. Thus the Servitors shape the life of those who care
        of their example; every court magician knows the banes set on their work, every
        reeve that they have no jurisdiction over the servants of the legal counsel.

        at least in my games it seems to be filled with terrorist assholes willing to
        go to any lengths against the Lords. This is sad, as the Shadow Cult is also
        the only really liberal theology in Maldor. Traditional witchcraft is weak in
        Maldor, but it makes for interesting sectarian disputes when it encounters its
        young, mad sibling faith.

        The Servitors are only a faint idea, wistful for a third way but impotent in
        the monotheistic, monolithic present. The Nine Celestials in chapter 32 provide
        a sketch of an elite mystery cult revolving around them.

          %a#no-gods{:name => "no-gods"} No Gods
        %p
          This is just the first of many chapters in the book to include explicit
          religions that even have magic powers. What does it mean, exactly, that Near
          “does not include gods”?
        %p
          The answer is simple: the Story Guide never considers celestial intent in the
          plays he makes, nothing ever happens on the initiative of gods, and gods never
          communicate, and especially never, ever take any stand on issues, even if their
          purported representatives do. As far as the Story Guide is concerned, he’s
          running a materialistic setting where having faith gives you super-powers,
          whatever the characters might think. This doesn’t even particularly mean that
          the characters are objectively wrong in their beliefs; it just means that even
          if they are right, that’s not part of the game, and their beliefs will never be
          affirmed by the setting authority, even if the story itself should.
        %p
          There are plenty of things the players can do with gods, even with the Story
          Guide thus constrained. Roll a PRAY (V) check, have your character go into
          stupor and afterwards claim to have spoken with the Sun Lord who told him that
          he’s actually Absolon Reborn? Sure, as long as it’s clear that we’re just
          talking about your character’s subjective experience. That sort of thing is
          completely in the player’s purview, the Story Guide can never claim that nuhuh,
          the Sun Lord didn’t talk to your character, because the Sun Lord wouldn’t – he
          doesn’t have that power, because the gods are not his to play.
        %p
          If the reader is wondering why we hash these nuances, the short answer is that
          this anti-god agenda is just another part of the humanistic strategy in TSoY,
          and a sort of safety rail against bad fantasy game habits: the Story Guide
          cannot have gods steal the story from the player characters when gods are not
          in his toolbox. Whatever choices characters make, whatever the consequences,
          the events play out without divine interventions, at least ones not backed
          mechanically by characters actually present in the story.

      The lords of Maldor run machines of war that will not, can not let the

      Militarily focused campaigns are an obvious choice in Maldor, the land wracked
      by war.  This is not a war game, however, so we do not want to burden players
      with making the right strategic choices – just like always, the choices we want
      to engender are over how much the characters are willing to risk and to what
      gain.  Right and wrong warcraft is judged on that basis.

        Most lords of Maldor maintain almost permanent armies, the bulk of which is
        formed of MILITIAS and GUARDS of infantry. The difference between the two is in
        whether the troop was formed by conscription or voluntarily. The military
        paradigm emphasizes disciplined troop action; foot soldiers are not expected to
        have initiative, but rather to use pre-learned maneuvers to move and fight in
        coordination. Militia sergeants are the best of the veterans, while guard
        sergeants are almost always mercenaries from the border marches where ancient
        tradition and terrain make the footman into the core of the army.
      %p
        Cavalry has the pride of place in modern Maldorian warcraft, foremost because
        cavalrymen are professional soldiers with superior morale. The ones that own
        their own horses and weapons are called KNIGHTS, while the rest are ARMSMEN and
        receive their arms from their liege. Cavalry sergeants are valued veteran
        armsmen or knights.
      %p
        The captains of all Maldorian military units are theoretically of noble blood,
        although foot units are considered much less prestigious and in practice often
        end up in the command of trusted veterans. There is not much formal careerism
        in the military of today; the land is much too chaotic and the armed forces of
        individual Lords in constant transition. The best a captain can do is to make
        himself and his unit gain in value in the eyes of the Lord – that is, if he
        doesn’t decide to lead his loyal troop out east to Ammeni, where mercenaries
        are paid well and respected highly for their superior fighting skills.

        Roleplayers usually have plenty of experience in running normal skirmish
        combats, so I won’t worry my head about those. Some other situations might
        require advice, however:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Warbands:
        %dd
          When a character has a vague number of extras backing him in combat, he has a
          WARBAND. This by itself does nothing, but it allows the character to try
          leading from the back (rolling BATTLE (R) as primary) or boosting his personal
          combat prowess with tactics (rolling BATTLE (R) in support) or train his troops
          (creating various Effects with BATTLE (R)). Basically it’s the Story Guide who
          decides whether a bunch of extras forms a warband; I’d let anything with armed
          adult men or equivalent willing to fight pass, as long as there’s more than a
          couple of them.
        %dt One against many:
        %dd
          When an individual character fights against a bunch of extras without
          leadership, promote one of the extras into a real secondary character. Give
          them a real motivation, too, not just “I want to kill the player character.”
        %dt Being underdog:
        %dd
          When a hero fights against another who has extras supporting him, assign
          circumstance penalties to the underdog. If both have support, don’t bother
          unless the difference in numbers or quality is cinematic – just like always
          with circumstance penalties.
        %dt Holding the line:
        %dd
          If a player character is not in command of a battle, he doesn’t have leverage
          to determine the outcome of the battle outright. The Story Guide decides the
          outcome in these situations, just like with any conflicts between secondary
          characters. A non-combatant player character or one fighting in the battle
          might still influence the outcome with partial stakes (see below).
        %dt Partial stakes:
        %dd
          This is important. When a character has insufficient leverage in any conflict
          to get his way, the Story Guide is responsible for downgrading the scope of the
          conflict stakes to match the character’s capabilities. In battle this is
          commonly seen when a player character is just one of the troops fighting; he
          may well run conflicts about whether he gets injured or captured himself, or to
          save the lives of others or to do other heroic things on the battlefield, but
          he can’t determine the outcome of the whole battle unless a suitable
          opportunity presents him with such leverage.
      %p
        As can be seen, battles with many participants work exactly like normal
        skirmishes as far as the mechanics are concerned. The characters that actually
        have dramatic goals in the situation get the spotlight, and this may or may not
        mean that a player character gets an opportunity to influence the battle
        outside his immediate vicinity.

      %p
        I’ll return to those partial stakes for a bit, because they are important when
        the whole campaign starts revolving around what characters can and can’t
        accomplish in battle. Specifically, how does superior LEVERAGE affect the
        stakes of a battle? This is how:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          There are so many enemies that the sparse defenders can only hope to delay,
          not to stop them. While the character’s GOAL might be to stop the enemy, the
          Story Guide downgrades the STAKES into “delay them long enough for a
          successful retreat”.
        %li
          The lone hero never even stops to consider fighting the enemy, they are so
          many. He can’t hope for stakes like “I win the battle”, alone as he is, so he
          accepts “I escape from their hands”.
      %p
        There are other ways of building asymmetric, biased stakes, but the basic
        principle is the same: when a character doesn’t have appropriate leverage to
        fight the forces arrayed against him properly, he has no choice but to accept
        lesser stakes. This is really obvious from a cinematic viewpoint; nobody ever
        questions it when the hero runs from superior forces. Still, sometimes
        roleplayers stare a bit too intently at the dicing rules of a game and start
        claiming that they have some sort of right to a “fair fight” against any
        comers.
      %p
        Now, in actual play the technique of partial stakes depends a lot on the Story
        Guide. A given campaign might be so superheroic that partial stakes would never
        come up: heroic swordsmen just up and face whole armies arranged against them,
        and win. However, I like my TSoY with a tad grimmer take, which is why I have
        crunch that actually formalizes the Story Guide judgment here: the key piece of
        rules material in this chapter is the SOLDIER IMBUEMENT, which says this same
        thing: a character with a professional Maldorian MILITARY UNIT backing him is
        actually unassailable on the open field by a single hero, barring magic or
        whatnot.
      %p
        MILITARY UNITS with the SOLDIER IMBUEMENT have SUPERIOR LEVERAGE in martial
        conflict, which means that lone heroes automatically lose against them if they
        try to clash directly. This is heavy stuff in the SOLAR SYSTEM context, so it’s
        definitely up to you whether you want to allow this option in your own
        campaign. If you do, remember that “auto-lose” only means that characters can’t
        contest the military unit directly on the field; they can still conflict over
        weaker stakes such as escaping, delaying, misdirecting and so on.
      %p
        Also, the basic strategy for a lesser force (and the one I’m shooting for here;
        it’s what they do in this sort of fiction) is to attack the unit cohesion of
        the military unit: units in disorder are useless as equipment. The character
        leading a military unit often has to choose between protecting the cohesion of
        his unit (by avoiding melee, for example) and actually doing anything in the
        battle. And of course characters can just choose other means apart from
        violence; a military unit is just as vulnerable to a convincing speech or
        major-scale magic as any other warband.

            Soldiers in Maldor are taught to fight with spears, swords and axes, depending
            on their role in the unit. This Ability can be used in directly violent
            conflicts, although it is not at its best in unarmed situations, ambushes,
            darkness or other exceptional conditions.
          %dt Cavalry (V)
          %dd
            Cavalry soldiers learn to maneuver and fight on horseback. This Ability can be
            used to ride well and for cavalry maneuvers on the battlefield, such as
            charges. A horseman stuck in close quarters still uses MELEE (V) to resolve
            those situations, however. Consequently Maldorian cavalry soldiers are
            generally expected to synergize their MELEE (V) and Cavalry Abilities.
          %dt Battle (R)
          %dd
            The Ability to plan and lead battles to achieve strategic objectives. A
            character needs a warband or more to execute such a plan, and Battle won’t
            protect his own person if he is attacked. Sometimes Battle can be used to win a
            war without conflict, should the opponent lack a similar Ability and thus be
            unable to prevent a defeat in detail.
          %dt Logistics (R)
          %dd
            The Ability concerns knowledge of the best practices of accounting and
            organizing major projects, such as supplying a military force on the move. It
            is useful for organizing large undertakings in civil engineering as well,
            although logistics are mostly practiced by the military sergeants in modern
            Maldor.
          %dt Secret of Discipline
          %dd
            The character knows how to train warbands into military units, which count as
            equipment for their commanders. Make a BATTLE (R) check to train the unit into
            equipment, as per the SECRET OF CREATION. The commander of such a unit may be
            disarmed by breaking the unit’s cohesion on the field, and the unit may be
            destroyed (or at least scattered from the field) by normal rules for destroying
            equipment. Cost: as per SECRET OF CREATION, except swap REASON and VIGOR costs.
          %dt Soldier Imbuement
          %dd
            A military unit with this imbuement has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE in battle against

            conflict.
          %dt Secret of Formation
          %dd
            When a character with this Secret fights in closed formation with MELEE (V),
            he gains bonus dice equal to the warband’s Effect value, if any. When imbued
            into a military unit, the commander gains bonus dice equal to equipment quality
            to BATTLE (R) checks appropriate for closed formation fighting. Cost: 1 VIGOR
          %dt Secret of Charge
          %dd
            When a character with this Secret charges as part of a warband with CAVALRY
            (V), he causes penalty dice to a resisting opponent equal to the unit’s Effect
            value, if any. When imbued into a military unit, the commander causes penalty
            dice equal to equipment quality to opponents resisting the unit. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Secret of Elite
          %dd
            If a character with this Secret has to make a Passive Ability check when part
            of a warband, he gets synergy with the commander’s BATTLE (R) as per the SECRET
            OF SYNERGY. When imbued into a military unit, the commander can protect unit
            cohesion and prevent it from breaking by suffering any results that would cause
            such as REASON-based Harm on himself.
          %dt Secret of Warfare
          %dd
            The character knows how to conduct major battles with multiple units attacking
            and supporting each other in coordination, allowing for such maneuvers as
            flanking, reserves and orderly retreats. Make a BATTLE (R) check to form an
            army out of several military units and warbands as an Effect. An opponent
            wanting to disrupt the army’s chain of command has to attack this Effect to do
            so. An army has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE against individual warbands when it comes to
            direct encounters on the battlefield; only another army may resist its might
            directly. Cost: 1 REASON per trained or restructured army, plus cost of
            creating and maintaining any Effects. Requirement: SECRET OF DISCIPLINE
          %dt Castle Imbuement
          %dd
            This imbuement is placed on a dedicated defensive structure, appropriately
            enough. A castle might be built as equipment with the SECRET OF CREATION
            (ENGINEERING), or a character might come to possess one by other means. Either
            way, the castle imbuement provides SUPERIOR LEVERAGE to a suitable defensive
            force against enemy warbands, making it impossible for the opponent to attack
            the defenders directly. Even if the enemy has the means to try storming the
            castle, they will suffer penalty dice to any Ability checks to do so equal to
            the current quality of the castle.
          %dt Secret of Siege Warfare
          %dd
            The character is familiar with classical siege warfare and may thus direct
            circumvallation, sapping, building and moving siege machines and so on. A siege
            conducted with these strategies may directly attack the Effect value of
            opposing fortifications with ENGINEERING (R) checks. The character’s war
            machines allow him to use ENGINEERING (R) to support in appropriate violent
            conflicts.
          %dt Secret of Field Surgeon
          %dd
            Civilian medicine in Maldor is non-invasive and mostly based on Three-Corner
            philosophy. A military field surgeon works with limited knowledge, but plenty
            of experience: when a character gets seriously injured, the field surgeon can
            work to stabilize him by activating this Secret. This prevents the character
            from bleeding to death and prepares him for long-term care with real medicinal
            practice. Additionally, Pool paid to activate this Secret also counts towards
            natural healing as if the patient had spent it. Cost: 1 REASON per Harm on the
            patient.
          %dt Secret of Evaluation
          %dd
            The character can find out the mechanical statistics of others by observing
            them in combat or training conditions. The player gets to ask one question per
            level of success on a BATTLE (R) check. Appropriate questions could involve
            ranking the character’s Pools against each other or against other characters,
            finding out the exact current value of a single Pool, finding out the
            character’s highest Ability and its level, recognizing a Secret the character
            used or whatever other questions the group finds reasonable; a lot depends on
            how the group handles this information normally. Cost: 1 REASON
          %dt Secret of Tactics
          %dd
            The player gets to choose and frame the turning-point of a given simple
            conflict, as the character influences the situation to unravel to his benefit.
            In practice this means that the player gets to choose the Abilities used by
            both sides of the conflict, as he describes the exact moment of conflict
            resolution in the fiction. Cost: 1 REASON for non-martial conflicts, or REASON
            equal to opposing BATTLE (R) check (if any) for martial ones.
          %dt An Example Unit
          %dd

        players might gravitate towards power-tripping with the mechanically cheap
        power provided here, which is of course fine, but not the actual point; the
        Story Guide should know where to go from there, as simply running combat after
        combat doesn’t do much in this game.

        I’m myself pretty fond of military science fiction after having had too much
        time in my hands earlier this decade and reading a bit too many paperback books
        by Lois McMaster Bujold, David Feintuch, David Weber and such. This literary
        genre has been on my mind a lot when playing TSoY in Maldor, as the military
        themes are similar: honor between fighting men, responsibility for the welfare
        of the men and the cause they fight for, obedience and contempt towards
        civilian authorities... Maldor is a great place for war stories of adventurous
        bend.
      %p
        A key issue here is that soldier characters need to be challenged morally just
        the same as everybody else. If their war happens to be just, then there might
        be division in the ranks or corrupt officers; if the troop thinks with one
        mind, perhaps the resources might not be enough to achieve all goals,
        necessitating gruesome triage; if everything can be achieved, perhaps the
        consequences of victory are where the actual issue resides; if all else is
        well, perhaps the problem is with the mind or family of the soldier himself? It
        is not acceptable to reduce military fiction into a straightforward calculus of
        won and lost battles.
      %p
        I’ll write more on this issue in the Chapter 12 wherein I consider the worst
        war Near knows today. Surprisingly enough, Lords of Maldor are not behind those
        atrocities. Not directly.

    %p
      %em Crunch adapted from Clinton’s book with original additions, some original fluff.
    %p
      When Maldor reigned supreme, a great magical working was attempted by wizards
      of utmost skill. Magical sight was utilized to reveal the underlying structure
      of the world. This new mysticism that partook of other magics of the age was
      called Three-Corner, for it unified mind to body with spirit.
    %p
      Emperor Absolon sponsored a great academy of magic for the research and
      teaching of this superior art. A great three-cornered fortress was erected in a
      secret place on the western hills to house the Three-Corner Academy. Cultural
      Inspection units were sent to trawl the world for secrets.
    %p
      At its zenith the Three-Corner Academy taught a clarified magical philosophy
      based on the dual triangles of Night and Day. Many highest officers of the
      court were drawn from the Academy, and ThreeCorner magic spread to far reaches
      of Near.
    %p
      Today the Academy is lost, but the magic itself survives in the courts of
      Maldor. Knowledge of the Three-Corner arts is feared and respected among the
      commoners and foreign peoples who know little difference between hucksters,
      witches and magical philosophers. Many wizards have taken to the roads in the
      hope of improving their lot in various ways.

      %p
        Students of the Three-Corner way learn magical FOCI, methods for unlocking the
        mind and seeing the world-that-is. There are six foci divided into two
        triangles, the Day and the Night. Like so:

      %p
        Of the two triangles the Day triangle was considered the more benign in the
        Academy, and the Night triangle was only taught to Day adepts who could handle
        the responsibility. Now, with the school scattered and third-generation
        knowledge being passed around, much of the structure has been lost. The Night
        foci are today the more common arts, even as they are considered evil magic (as
        opposed to just dangerous) in a manner that was unknown in the past.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#the-focus-abilities{:name => "the-focus-abilities"} The Focus Abilities
        %p
          Each of the Three-Corner foci is an Ability that is learned separately. They
          hardly come naturally to humans, so a player can only write a focus on the
          character sheet if the character has had schooling in the art. This is
          surprisingly common in Maldor among all social classes, as many arcanists were
          reduced into village wise men after the Year of Shadow. Elsewhere it’s mostly
          learned sages who know of the foci, as well as the occasional traveler.
        %p
          As a rule of thumb, if the players decide to give a character access to
          Three-Corner based on his background, he would usually know one or both of the
          triangles, not just one or two Abilities at random – understanding comes at
          once for each triangle.

            %dt Creation (V)
            %dd
              CREATION is to bring matter into being. The character can create a small amount
              – a handful or so – of a basic element (fire, earth, water, air) out of
              nothing.
            %dt Destruction (V)
            %dd
              DESTRUCTION is to make matter disperse. The character can erode materials he
              touches. How this looks like depends on the player, but it is obviously
              supernatural.
            %dt Enhancement (I)
            %dd
              ENHANCEMENT is to make things more like themselves, increasing order. The
              character can improve and strengthen items and people. The Ability can be used
              to support most anything else, but does not do anything by itself.
            %dt Transformation (I)
            %dd
              TRANSFORMATION is to change things into something else, decreasing order. The
              character can force naturally pliable things to take on a new shape without
              tools or containers.
            %dt Divination (R)
            %dd
              DIVINATION is to reveal purpose. The character can sense magical auras in
              things and people, as well as see invisible things and the disposition of
              animals and people.
            %dt Enthrallment (R)
            %dd
              ENTHRALLMENT is to control purpose. The character can force another being to
              bend to his will. The target is well aware of the magical compulsion.

      %p
        The Three-Corner foci are normal Abilities in most respects. As pure Abilities
        they are pretty limited, however, and more powerful magical workings often
        require the wizard to combine magical Secrets in their workings. Furthermore,
        all Three-Corner magic has certain rules and limitations that hold true unless
        lifted somehow:
      .section
        %h4

          %li Only one target may be affected by one working.
          %li
            A magical effect is either instantaneous or lasts one hour; in the latter
            case the player has to make the working into an Effect to uphold the magic
            for longer than the one scene.
          %li All Three-Corner magic may be resisted by the target with RESIST (R).
      .section
        %h4
          %a#complex-magical-effects{:name => "complex-magical-effects"} Complex magical effects
        %p
          In actual play a magical working is often created by combining the powers of
          several foci and Secrets that modify their limitations. For example, a wizard
          who wanted to use any of the foci at distance would need to modify the basic
          function with the SECRET OF MAGICAL HAND.
        %p
          When a wizard makes a working that requires the use of several foci, the focus
          Abilities are tested normally as a support chain, starting with the best
          Ability. All checks need to succeed for a working to be successful.
        %p
          Complex Three-Corner magic usually requires the character to spend Pool points
          to power the magic. Discretionary costs are assigned by the player to any Pool
          associated with the foci used by the working.
        %p
          In play we often need to figure out which foci and Secrets a character needs to
          activate to achieve a certain magical effect. The sensibilities of the group,
          often expressed by the Story Guide, are a fine guide in this. The example
          spells later on will provide a fine guide to the degree of fanciful freedom
          we’ve found optimal for fun play.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#spells{:name => "spells"} Spells
        %p
          A wizard who wants to reuse the same magical working again and again will do
          well to consider creating a SPELL of it. Spells are cheaper and quicker to cast
          than free workings, but less flexible as well. For example, a wizard could make
          a working that dropped a big rock on his enemy; this would require the CREATION
          (V) focus, SECRET OF INVISIBLE HAND and the SECRET OF CREATE VOLUME. As a spell
          it would look like this:
        %blockquote
          %dl.docutils
            %dt Spell of Rockfall
            %dd
              The caster points at a spot and a large rock drops on it from nowhere. The
              rock disappears after an hour. Requires a CREATION (V) check. Cost: CREATE
              VOLUME: 3 VIGOR MAGICAL HAND: 1 VIGOR Total: 3+1-1= 3 VIGOR
        %p
          As can be seen, a spell gains the wizard a one Pool discount in casting cost.
          However, it is less flexible: the caster cannot choose the size of the rock,
          drop something other than a rock or otherwise modify the working when casting
          it as a spell.
        %p
          Spells cost an Advance to learn, just like Secrets. A character can further
          improve the spell’s cost by spending several Advances on it, even making the
          spell free. In traditional academy magic the cost of a spell after discounts
          and assigning discretionary costs turns out as balanced as possible between the
          involved Pools.
        %p
          Another benefit of spells is that, depending on the group’s aesthetics, they
          might be simpler and quicker to cast than freeform magical workings. In my
          games, for example, a spell is much more feasible than any other working in
          time-constraint situations, as the wizard has practiced this particular working
          many times before.
        %p
          A final benefit of a spell is that a character can learn one even if he doesn’t
          know the different Secrets that were used in creating it. This is useful for
          Three-Corner dabblers or characters that want to specialize.

        %p
          Three-Corner is supposed to be one of the most flexible and comprehensive
          magical theories in Near – to a degree of arrogance, in fact. Thus we might
          well presume that the Three-Corner Secrets depicted here are only a small part
          of the whole magical tradition. The group should definitely create new Secrets
          to give Three-Corner magicians the tools to do almost anything they want.
          Magicians can research new solutions, too, arduous as that might be.
        %p
          This is not to say that all feats of magic should be equally easy. Perhaps
          there are some blind spots to the comprehensively bland, scientific approach
          Three-Corner takes to magic. The Story Guide is unlikely to allow improvisation
          with a system this regimented. There is no poetic mystery to Three-Corner –
          whether this is a flaw could be a major theme in play.

        The Three-Corner Academy was never as influential on the religious and
        otherworldly life of Maldor as when it came to an end, scattering the masters
        and students alike all over the world. Now every court of any note boasts a
        court magician of supposedly vast power and knowledge; every village has a
        physician or craftsman with some small shard of the thrice-wound philosophy.
        Even outside Maldor proper it is rare to encounter a sage who’d fail to list
        the dual triangles.
      %p
        Academy magic was atheistic, mystical and alchemical, convinced of its
        universal character and superiority of the message, which was nevertheless
        considered too elevated and complex for the common man. In their own mind
        academy tricornerists formed a secret elite of the Empire, one that was
        spiritually ascendant simply by the virtue of their practice. It was said that
        Three-Corner philosophy was the true secret, with the magic an afterthought.
      %p
        Today the understanding of the thought behind the magic is considerably less
        certain and unified; two practitioners of the magic do not necessarily see eye
        to eye on even what the dual balance achieved by the Three-Corner practitioner
        is supposed to mean. Many tricornerists are members of the Celestial cults,
        unsatisfied or unknowing of the cosmology behind their own practice. When the
        magic is practiced by little more than hucksters and hedge magicians, it is no
        wonder if they mix in RITUAL MAGIC (R) practices and other ideas; everybody
        swears that theirs is the pure lineage of the Lost Academy, but sometimes their
        ideas are total opposites of each other. Maldor is a xenophobic, traumatized
        land. When rumors of the Shadow Cult rise, a wandering Three-Corner wizard may
        find himself being burnt as a witch. It is a horrible death.

              creation to share the space with other matter. Depending on the nature and
              shape of the creation, this might result in impalement, explosive displacement
              or instant and uniform mixtures of matter. Cost: 1+ the target’s RESIST (R)
              check in VIGOR.

      %p
        The Story Guide should remember that Three-Corner magic still benefits and is
        limited by all the normal rules that concern all Abilities and Secrets. For
        example, the following points have sometimes proven elusive:
      .section
        %h4
          %a#resisting-three-corner{:name => "resisting-three-corner"} Resisting Three-Corner
        %p
          When magic is used indirectly against a target, such as by destroying the floor
          below him or dropping something heavy on him, he is still allowed to resist the
          outcome (and resulting Harm) normally, provided that he has any leverage at
          all. Casting the magic takes time and it is not always overwhelming, so a
          simple REACT (I) check to jump out of the way or even ENDURE (V) to withstand
          the magic’s effects is quite appropriate. Giving the wizard a gut full of steel
          before he finishes the spell also works.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#imaginary-detail{:name => "imaginary-detail"} Imaginary detail
        %p
          Speaking of finishing spells, different groups imagine the practical craft of
          Three-Corner in different ways. The text is intentionally vague. My imagination
          often involves chanting, gestures and magical ingredients that are mostly
          glossed over as mechanical issues. Still, I’ve been known to issue penalty dice
          or deny usage of Three-Corner due to leverage issues when a character would
          have had to whip some exotic and unlikely magic up in an eye blink. My rule of
          thumb is that a one-focus spell takes a couple of seconds to set up, but
          anything more complex takes up more time, to a degree where I don’t usually
          allow multi-focus workings (except as spells) in split-second action sequences.
        %p
          The important part is to follow the group’s expectations in this matter. If
          there are none, then explore what the magic feels and tastes like! Ask the
          player to make the calls to find out what your magic looks like.
        %p
          One particular approach is to make the academic paradigms described in Keys
          lift their weight: what the wizard believes and strives for in his magic could
          influence his methods in working the magic, answering these questions.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#measuring-magnitudes{:name => "measuring-magnitudes"} Measuring Magnitudes
        %p
          Most SOLAR SYSTEM mechanics eschew fictional measurements. Typically we only
          care of dramatic measure, which is much easier to ascertain without busting out
          the fictional rulers to ascertain distances, volumes and such. Three-Corner
          magic, however, uses plenty of fictional measures, just as one would expect of
          a scientific magical discipline. How does one judge these matters?
        %p
          My own rule of thumb is always that the Story Guide is the final arbiter of
          fictional measurements. When a character tries to block a cave entrance with a
          big magical rock, say, the Story Guide decides according to setting fidelity
          and dramatic coordination whether the entrance is small enough for a third
          magnitude CREATE VOLUME or what. Similarly, when a wizard cloaks himself with
          magical invisibility, it’s the Story Guide who decides when the one-hour
          duration of magic runs out and the spell needs to be recast.

          %a#three-corner-in-conflict{:name => "three-corner-in-conflict"} Three-Corner in Conflict
        %p
          A basic question for any Secrets that cost a lot of Pool to make something
          happen: what if another character conflicts the event and takes it into
          extended conflict? After all, the other character has a right to resist, but it
          also sucks to spend 10 Pool on a spell and have it do nothing.
        %p
          The simple answer is that while the conflict is still on-going, the wizard’s
          spell has not resolved yet: the character can continue casting his spell in
          extended conflict, making appropriate Ability checks or even doing something
          else while the magic percolates (or whatever; it’s magic). The spell will only
          ultimately fail if the character stops casting it in the fiction or he loses
          the conflict (which was over the success of that spell in the first place).
        %p
          If spells are cast during on-going extended conflict, the opponent might have
          to take a Defensive Action to cope with the new situation and change their
          goals to include preventing the spell, but they still get to declare opposition
          against the magic. It depends on the effects of the spell whether this is
          worthwhile for the opponent, of course.

        %p
          Almost any sensible magics a proper wizard would hope for can usually be created just by
          combining one of the focus Abilities and one Secret. For example:
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Burning your foe to ash
          %dd
            would be accomplished with DESTRUCTION (V) + MAGICAL HAND. This would cost
            just one VIGOR point for doing it at a distance. If you had several enemies to
            burn, adding MAGICAL CONTAGION would take care of them all.
          %dt Flying
          %dd
            can be done with smart creation, but I added a GRAVITY Secret specifically
            because I wanted an easy and cheap way of flying about. So Transformation (I) +
            GRAVITY do the trick.
          %dt Charming people
          %dd
            is done with ENTHRALLMENT (R) + GENTLE TOUCH. The latter is important, as most
            don’t take it very well when they are magically controlled.
        %p
          As you can see, most things the wizard wants to do can be done with just one
          Ability and Secret, even if the bulk of the text is concerned with multi-focus
          workings, spells and such. There are fault-lines to this, explored by the
          example spells on the facing page; sometimes a wizard might create a new Secret
          to take care of a weakness, but when he can’t, all sorts of roundabout methods
          are devised by powermad sorcerers.
        %p
          The players should also remember that the rules on what a given working can
          accomplish and what it can’t are basically as flexible as the group wants them
          to be. The example spells can be read with this in mind: the system is followed
          to the letter only where constraint and fine detail work are fun, not where
          they become a chore.

          The Three-Corner wizard would do anything and everything he wants were it not
          for the prohibitive expenses in Pool. Some things are almost insanely expensive
          for him: these are usually the ones with magnitudes listed in the corresponding
          Secret.
        %p
          There’s not much to be done about how expensive Three-Corner magic is in terms
          of experience and Pool costs. Looking at it from the player’s viewpoint, the
          idea is not that this is a way to amazing power; rather, it’s interesting to
          play with the limitations and self-perception of the wizard, and the
          expectations others place upon him. Often the wizard will find that he is
          trusted to do much greater things than anyone but the Sun Lord himself could
          accomplish.

              from horrid battlecries to beautiful ballads, depending on the skills of the

              In Antiquity this sort of magic was common: the crystal holds one spell, which
              may be cast forth by the wielder with a Passive Ability check. In this case it
              is FALL TO THE SKY, cast with a REACT (I) check. Imbuements: Mundane Spellcraft
              Fall to the Sky (I) Null-Rating (I) Cost: 1 INSTINCT per scene. 4 INSTINCT to
              cast the spell. Creation: The crystal really has just one magical function, so

              The Triangle Manteau is a wondrous cloak of legend purportedly gifted to

              activated with Passive Ability checks: For 2 REASON it turns the user
              invisible. For 2 INSTINCT it flies, spread out, carrying up to three people.

              (I) 2 x Mundane Spellcraft Protection Spell (V) Null-rating (I) Cost: 1 VIGOR,
              INSTINCT and REASON per scene. Creation: There are three distinct magics in the

      The ratkin are a new thing in Near, unknown to histories of Antiquity. They are
      intelligent like humans, but remain savage and primal like their rodent
      forebears. Ratkin are generally distrusted by humans who consider them filthy
      thieves – neither descriptor is completely misleading.
    %p
      Chaotic collectives of ratkin make their nests in ruins of Maldor, doing their
      best to understand the civilization humans left behind. They can be fiercely
      avaricious, all the more so for the fact that they do not understand ownership;
      as far as the ratkin are concerned, you own only what you can defend. Players
      who choose to play ratkin will do well to read the Beastkin material (chapter
      27). All ratkin take the mandatory SECRET OF RATKIN as their first Secret.

        Ratkin basically look like anthropomorphized rats, complete with tails and
        whiskers. The shared heritage is obvious to both the ratkin themselves and any
        outside observer: ratkin speak gutturally, sometimes run on all fours and in
        general act like overgrown, intelligent rats. About three to four feet tall,
        they have pointed button noses, whiskers, and are covered in either grey,
        brown, or black fur, with the occasional albino all-white ratkin.
      %p
        Perhaps even more striking is the LITTER, the basic social group among ratkin,
        completely instinctual. A given litter consists of three or four ratkin and ten
        to twenty normal rats; the young ratkin are only distinguishable by their
        thumbs and size, being half again as large as their rat kin.
      %p
        The young ratkin learn from an early age to fight vigorously for everything,
        starting with their mother’s teat that the rest of the litter would gladly hog
        if given a chance. The ratkin instinctively know to restrain themselves in
        their constant scrapping, avoiding serious injury. These instincts carry over
        to adulthood: ratkin generally own only what they can carry and do not hesitate
        to fight a bit for whatever they desire.
      %p
        Even without intelligence acting into it, the litter is fiercely loyal to each
        other and quite able to engage in real violence against outside threats. A
        predator attacking a member of the litter is often an offense that is taken
        more seriously than threats against the individual ratkin himself.
      %p
        This social structure remains the same for the HORDE, the larger community the
        litter is born into. The horde might consist of hundreds of ratkin and
        thousands of rats as long as it remains successful as a community.

        Ratkin are most common in Maldor and usually only appear in the environs of the
        old empire. A partial reason for this is that Maldor is a fertile environment
        for the bestial creatures: the ancient walled cities that have long fallen into
        ruin provide an ideal environment for these new beings that thrive among the
        remains of the ancient culture that came before them. This might make such
        places dangerous to other people, as in the ruins the ratkin horde truly is at
        the top of the food chain.
      %p
        Ratkin are social and curious creatures capable of modeling their life on human
        culture. Ownership is something they have a great difficulty understanding,
        however, so it is not uncommon for human societies to ostracize and marginalize
        ratkin, treating individuals as pests, pets, criminals or worse. This is not
        true of all human societies, certainly: the people of Khale accept ratkin as
        natural, and allow them to form tribes that interact with humans on equal
        footing.
      %p
        While most ratkin belong in litter communities that have various relationships
        with humanity, some ratkin end up loners due to ill fate befalling their litter
        or simply because they like the new, civilized lifestyle promised by going
        after humans. Such ratkin prove adaptive, working actively to form bonds with
        any company they meet; a ratkin without a litter is often depressed and moody.

        Wild rumors fly in Maldor of ratkin living in the old cities. Some stories
        elevate albino ratkin above their peers in respect and mysterious powers. It is

        to the same sort of ruin, being a nest of pallid ratkin hostile to humans.

        Ratkin are considered harbingers of disease by many. One particular disease at
        least is real, although the ratkin himself would probably not know of it: the
        SECRET OF TOXOPLASM is contracted by close relations with ratkin, such as
        drinking from a well they use. Most people of Near would not be equipped to
        even notice the parasite, but it is known that people who associate with ratkin
        sometimes turn... strange. Player characters in danger of contracting the
        toxoplasm might avoid it with an ENDURE (V) check, like any disease.
      %p
        Should a Maldorite human get over his preconceptions and win the trust of a
        horde to his side, there are many things the beings breeding in the body of Old
        Maldor might be able to provide: nobody else knows the old cities as well as
        the ratkin living in them do – ratkin who gather, compulsively sort and even
        worship treasures of a civilization that is at this point starting to be as
        foreign to the modern Maldor as it is to the ratkin themselves.

            The character is highly resistant to toxins and disease. When succumbing to
            such is at issue, the player may opt to pay VIGOR to turn a failed ENDURE (V)
            check inconclusive; the character has a slight fever and does not develop a
            resistance to the disease, but does not suffer any ill effects, either. Cost:

            communication is incomprehensible or even invisible to outsiders, consisting of
            small signals. The player may spend Instinct to allow the character to

            The toxoplasm is a parasite living inside a host brain, most likely a human. A
            character with the toxoplasm is considered ratkin for the purposes of
            BOND-SPEECH. In addition, the character suffers a penalty die against ratkin in
            social conflicts. The character might be able to use LITTER BOND (I) after
            living among ratkin for a long while. Requirement: The character is human.
          %dt Secret of Albino Weird (Secret)

            The character is an albino, with white fur and red eyes. He suffers a penalty
            die for everything he does in direct daylight, due to his sensitiveness. The
            character also has a weird: in times of stress the character manifests a
            culture-appropriate magical Secret of the player’s choice; if the Secret
            requires the use of an Ability, the Ability can be substituted by BESTIALITY
            (V). If the character learns the Secret in question, swap the weird to a
            different Secret. The Secret may also be swapped prematurely in a
            life-threatening situation. Cost: 1 REASON to use, 3 INSTINCT to force the

      %p
        My experience playing with ratkin was for the longest time that they are a
        problem, not a solution: it always seems that when you start playing TSoY with
        a new group, there is inevitably one player who gravitates towards a ratkin (or
        goblin for that matter) player character over any other option – this always
        seems to be because that player wants to avoid PROTAGONISM: his ratkin
        character is a hanger-on with no discernible issues of his own and seemingly no
        other function in the campaign than to attack squealing vigorously against
        whoever happens to threaten the real main characters. The ratkin with its
        humorous appearance and inhuman immunity to human issues is the perfect
        hanger-on character for the player who couldn’t care less about making a real
        effort in the game.
      %p
        This all changed when I figured out that I should not be moaning the fact that
        some of my friends wanted to play sidekicks; I should embrace it. When you have
        something like four players in the game, where’s the problem in allowing one or
        even two to play unabashed sidekicks? Removing ratkin wouldn’t remove this
        need, and why would we need more than a couple of heroic leads, anyway? Looking
        at it this way, ratkin are perfect: they’re comedic and sympathetic, can be
        completely inefficient in messing up the game, and suitably compact to fit in
        the hero’s backpack. The KEY OF CHEESE is an example of this shift in my
        strategy: I can support the comedic role actively, and I should.
      %p
        This is not to say that ratkin can’t be used seriously; they do certainly have
        many fascinating and serious aspects. I am personally especially fond of their
        nature as genuinely non-human people in Near, outside the Human Equation and
        one of the beastkin. I consider it a fully valid thematic challenge to ask a
        ratkin character to prove that he is actually people and not just an animal, in
        whatever manner a given campaign would consider such an issue.

          I personally like to think that ratkin have spread out from Maldor and mostly
          appear in there and the surrounding lands, such as Ammeni and Khale. They are a
          versatile lot, of course, and breed fast, so no place is inconceivable.
        %p
          However, Maldor and ratkin go together like bread and butter for me simply
          because the ratkin are such a perfect foil for a campaign situated in Maldor.
          Players of WARHAMMER of course know what I’m about here: in the world of that
          game the human Empire (quite reminiscent of Maldor) is being besieged by evil
          ratkin called Skaven, monsters that come at night from under the floorboards.
          The ratkin in TSoY are not such a clear-cut evil, but the principle is the
          same: rigid civilization is being challenged by unbridled savagery that breeds
          under the very noses of the Lords of Maldor.
        %p
          A Story Guide can get quite a lot of mileage out of ratkin in Maldor even if no
          player character initially has anything to do with them: ratkin can feature as
          members of a revolutionary movement, as barbarians at the gates, as inhuman
          pests carrying pestilence, as assassins or spies and many other things besides.
          If nothing else, Maldorian Lords have been known to pay an extermination fee
          for the pesky critters, which is sure to make for passionate inter-species
          relations.

          I’ve never gotten much out of ratkin in Ammeni; the thing with seemingly
          sub-human creatures in Ammeni is that they can be enslaved and exploited, but
          goblins are so much better for that that ratkin are mostly left as pests to be
          exterminated. This of course makes them natural allies to the slave class of
          the society, but that’s true of goblins as well. I’ve been told that ratkin
          with their litter bond make for a reliable slave species naturally inclined to
          be vulnerable to threats towards their litter-mates, so who knows.
        %p
          Khaleans, on the other hand, have some resonance with ratkin, as their
          communal, ancestry focused culture harmonizes with ratkin nature. A whole
          Khalean tribe made of ratkin makes perfect sense, insofar as they can adapt to
          living in the wilderness.
        %p
          Gorenite highlands, the eastern archipelago and the whole southern continent
          are relatively inhospitable to the natural strengths of the ratkin. I might
          have some appear anywhere humans live, but they could hardly be numerous.

        The TSoY theory is that non-humans are just as likely to share the mainstream
        culture as they are to develop their own, depending on conditions. Consequently
        we get ratkin adopting human names, which might seem funny to humans. A
        civilized ratkin might well use the second name of their human best friend, for
        example.
      %p
        In practice I often find myself using the sort of animal-sounding guttural,
        punchy names we’ve all learned from Disney and whatnot. Or purely descriptive
        primitivist names, “Black Paw” and such. Not an issue as far as I’m considered.
        Sometimes low-Reason ratkin of mine don’t even have a spoken name, as they
        don’t strictly speaking need it with their litter.

      powerhouse where few were hungry and most were happy.

      This empire fell, not to opposing armies, but doom from the heavens. A fiery
      dot appeared in the sky, bright enough to be seen in midday. The people,

      they examined the fire on the edge of existence.

      kingdom. Mothers held their crying children to their breasts, trying to block
      the fell rays of this celestial fire from their babies' eyes; peasants grew
      fearful as their beasts moaned in confusion at night; priests proclaimed the
      end of the world was coming. And all looked to their Emperor, Absolon, for
      guidance, but Absolon had none.
    %p
      A foreign magician, Hanish, came before Absolon, hundreds of miles of dirt
      caked on his body from running. He swore that the rituals conducted by
      Absolon's sorcerers had unleashed this terror, and it must be revoked, else the
      world would be destroyed.
    %p
      The court sorcerers heard this and were none too pleased. They had Hanish
      imprisoned and tried to turn Absolon's ear away from his ravings. The words
      bothered Absolon greatly, though, and he went to Hanish's cell on a dark night,
      when the clouds obscured the burning among the stars.
    %p
      Absolon threatened Hanish with death if this curse was not removed from the
      world. Hanish laid himself before Absolon's sword. Moved by Hanish's bravery
      and defiance, Absolon took him to his side as his highest advisor and they
      spent many hours talking alone.  Rumors and rebellions ripped Maldor apart. The
      people said their Emperor spent all his days privately conversing with the man
      who would destroy the world.  Within another three months, this fiery orb
      illuminated everything in burnt red. The sun could not even be seen.
    %p
      In the midst of open revolt, chaos, madness, prophets proclaiming the death of
      all life, assassinations, and depravity, Absolon and Hanish emerged from the
      Emperor's quarters. The Sky Fire had grown no bigger than half the sky, but its
      heat was now intolerable and the entire sky was painted in eternal sunset as
      the globe burned away the air.
    %p
      Absolon and Hanish stood on the steps of the Emperors Palace, hand in hand, and
      began a weird chant, intoning ancient syllables which spread throughout the
      angry crowds outside, calming them. This chant lasted for three days, and it is
      said that by the end of those three days, the entire Empire had taken up its
      rhythmic syllables. The Fire moved slowly across the sky, though, and at the
      end of the three days, crossed the western horizon and night fell again.
      Absolon and Hanish collapsed on the stairs where they chanted, their spirits
      gone and bodies broken.
    %p Then, the world halted.
    %p
      In the midst of night, the world shook with such a rumble that buildings fell,
      cracks opened spewing lava, and mountains formed out of plains-land. Men wept
      and tore their clothes, animals stampeded, and the elderly died of shock. A red
      glow came from every horizon, with black smoky clouds billowing. The clouds
      grew and grew as the earth continued to shake for days on end, the sun barely
      visible, and finally even blotted out that orb of life-giving light.
    %p
      For a year, the earth quivered and the sun rose no more, with only black clouds
      looking down on humanity. The earth froze. For one year, through the harshest
      of winters, people died of plague, starvation, and madness. By the end of that
      year, the population of the known world was a tenth of what it had been.
    %p
      One year after its disappearance, the sun rose weakly in the sky, barely
      shining through the breaking clouds. People driven to primitivism stuck their
      heads out of their caves, hovels, and homes to see the beloved sun as it rose
      to the middle of the sky and the foul darkness broke around it. When it set,
      though, living persons everywhere shook with horror.
    %p
      A moon rose in the sky. Never had a moon been seen in the world. The only
      object ever seen in the night sky was the dread Sky Fire, which this bore too
      much a resemblance to. Its pale light threw dark shadows onto the land. Worse,
      when the sun rose the next day, this moon – three times larger – eclipsed the
      sun, a black Shadow Moon rimmed in fire.
    %p
      Three hundred years have passed. Every night, the moon still rises, a terrible
      eye over the world. Some people quiver in abject fear. And some heroes fight
      the Shadow, in the darkest caves, the most decayed of civilizations, and the
      blackest hearts.

    This movement centers upon the dominant northern power in Near, the Houses of

      Ammeni is a sensual land of beauty and death, a place where human perceptions
      are overpowered by the strong spices, garish fabrics, power and helplessness.
      The land and the people answer powerfully to instincts of lust and hate, they
      are shaped by it all.

      “Ammeni” is the land ruled by the Houses of Ammeni, seven mercantile entities
      of immense influence. They are the only law in the land, their traditions the
      only values people believe in. Theirs is a poisonous influence that marks the
      people to the bone. Ammeni lands reach from the Sea of Teeth to the eastern
      coasts, making them a linchpin of trade for all of northern Near. The original
      plantations are mostly scattered along the River of Vipers, their bases of
      power extending all over the Zaru delta. Ventures of Ammeni reach far to the
      south, and with the war into the lands of Khale as well.

        Ammeni, being incredibly hot and wet, is extremely fertile. The majority of the
        Houses' business is growing rice and fruits and farming fish and water buffalo.
        These staples, plus the chilies grown further in the west, provide them with an
        endless source of trade. Their navy is powerful and is used for shipping, not
        only for Ammeni, but to allied merchants in Maldor, where it makes a tidy
        profit on the deal. Ammeni is also home to Near's most wondrous drugs and
        deadliest poisons. A career in death is definitely a lucrative one here. The
        items Ammeni is most deficient in, yet craves, are metals and jewels. Most of
        their trade is for these two goods.
      %p
        Power in Ammeni comes from the seven Houses, plantations which have grown into
        both tremendous mercantile houses and governmental entities. The “House” refers
        not only to the ruler of the House, or the business, but also the land that
        House controls. Within a House, laws are determined by the ruler of that House
        or his staff, and are usually capriciously enforced. Trade law is created by
        majority vote among the rulers of the seven Houses, the Council, which are
        normally embroiled in the covert sabotage and annexation of each other, forming
        alliances that last only weeks before backstabbing tears them apart.

          %dd
            Ammeni knowledge of bodily functions is the most extensive of the nations of
            Near. This Ability can be used for surgery, torture and bizarre piercing arts
            sometimes inflicted on decorative servants. Practitioners tend to be respected
            and wellpaid craftsmen.
          %dt Assassination (I)

            The art of silent, sudden death. The Ability is not so much concerned with
            martial skill as it is with a compartmentalized mind necessary for cold-blooded
            killing. An encyclopedic knowledge of the instruments of murder follows. Use
            this Ability for any exotic, pre-meditated killing, such as leaking poison into
            a sleeping person’s mouth via a string.
          %dt Bladework (I)
          %dd
            This Ability is used for all sorts of intricate knife skills from tricks to
            fighting to crafts. It is typical to both high and low classes in Ammeni, where
            men display bravado with knives and women are expected to hide their protective
            blades intimately. The Ability may support in many sorts of social, craft and
            violent situations and even be the main Ability of a focused turning-point.
          %dt Sex (I)
          %dd
            Ammeni culture takes sex somewhat seriously as a craft and art form. Practice
            is not entirely egalitarian; women, especially house slaves and professional
            entertainers, are expected to be better at it. The Ability is useful
            accompaniment for CHARM (I) in seduction, and in general usable as a sort of
            artistic and knowledge Ability related to sexual performance, reproduction
            biology and sexual hygiene. Despite their purposeful sensuality, Ammeni are no
            smarter than others over what sex means; expression ranges all over the place,
            even more so than in less sensual cultures.

          %dd
            Others may know how to dance, but the Ammeni entertainers are the best there
            is. The Ability is useful as an artistic thing, which, as we know, means that
            the player needs to make it useful by playing towards that sort of content.
          %dt Bamboo Warrior (V)
          %dd
            Most weapons and armor in the metal-poor Ammeni are made of bamboo, a
            flexible, common material in the area. This Ability is good for creating
            weapons and armor out of bamboo, as well as using polearms and such made of the
            light material effectively. Originally this was a peasant art of defense, but
            today independent peasants are few and bamboo is cut for professional soldiers.
          %dt Secret of Kata Nei
          %dd
            Kata Nei is a bamboo fighting style mostly favored by high-class Ammeni. It
            utilizes improvised weapons, preferentially untreated bamboo stalks, which the
            fighter cuts and splinters into nasty instruments during the fight. The
            character gains bonus dice to his BAMBOO WARRIOR (V) checks in a fight by
            breaking his weapons: each expended bamboo stalk gains one die, to a maximum of
            two (one for each hand) per check. Replacing the weapons mid-fight ranges from
            trivial (i.e. in a bamboo forest) to impossible; in extended conflict it
            requires either advance preparations or a defensive round spent in procuring
            replacements.
          %dt Secret of Bamboo Mercenary
          %dd
            Most mercenary officers in Ammeni are from Maldor, but half of the men are
            locals as well. Those units that cannot afford metal arms are forced to adapt
            to native conditions. The character with this Secret can use MELEE (V) and
            BAMBOO WARRIOR (V) interchangeably.
          %dt Secret of Healing
          %dd
            When the character is healing another with an Ability check, he can make an
            Effect off the result. As long as he maintains the Effect, the target character
            heals one Harm under the Effect level for every scene of bed rest. However, if
            the patient acts against the Effect’s recovery instructions, he suffers the
            Effect level as Harm as his wounds reopen.
          %dt Secret of Ritual Dance (specify)
          %dd
            The character has learned a specific, complex dancing performance purported to
            have wondrous power. If any character declares that a Secret his character
            possesses would be greatly supported by the preternatural qualities of this
            particular dance, this will be so: not only can the dancer support the Secret
            in action, but he can also share his Pool points with the user of the Secret.
            The player should keep a list of the Secrets that have been associated with the
            dance under this Secret. Cost: the other character pays REASON equal to the
            number of Secrets aided by this particular dance before adding his.

        Ammenites are known outside their country for their cruelty and decadence. The
        appearance is misleading, however: only the richest of Ammenites have the
        opportunity for cruelty and the ability for decadence. The rest of them are
        merely opportunists, making the best deals they can in a colonial society. The
        upper class of Ammenites, however, are decadent to an extreme, clothing
        themselves in the finest silk and eating bizarre delicacies grown only in the
        fertile delta soil. Ammenites are the descendants of Maldor, although they do
        not like to be reminded of this fact. Their language is much like the language
        of Maldor, but is filled with pops and flecks in between words to convey
        connotation.

        A full five percent of the population of Ammeni belongs to the hyper-wealthy
        House families, although many of these are not related by blood. The habitual
        assassination of family members means that ambitious types may rise quickly.
        Slavery is common in Ammeni, and at least twenty-five percent of the population
        is made of slaves, many of them from the former nation of Zaru. The rest of the
        population are either what we would know as middle management – low-level
        employees assigned to control slaves and supervise menial labor – or poor
        freemen, who try to attract as little attention as possible, and often leave
        Ammeni to become wanderers or traders.

        The Ammenites collect art of other cultures more than they create their own:
        the acquisition of art is a hobby for the upper classes. Native Ammenite art is
        bizarre, focusing on themes of oppression and the inevitability of death. The
        most famous Ammenite painting is of a rice patty, red with blood, with tall
        stalks rising to the sky; the most famous book is the story of the last 24
        hours of a rich, mad man. Zaru slaves do create art as well, although mostly
        ritual chants made of gibberish that manages to convey emotion. Their funeral
        dirges are known to bring even the strongest Ammenites to tears, which brings
        horrible wrath upon them.

        The food of Ammeni, however, is considered a delicacy. Hot and spicy, full of
        cream, rice, and noodles, as well as odd ingredients such as slugs, uncooked
        quail eggs, and fish-eyes, it evokes either love or disgust in most people.
        They make a rice wine that is similar: either astounding or repulsive,
        depending on the taster, and they take large amounts of poiture, the pollen of
        a gleaming white flower that grows wild in the rice fields of Ammeni. Poiture
        puts people into a deep relaxed state much like slumber where the sense of time
        becomes elongated. The Ammenites eschew religion, worshipping only gold and
        riches. The Council of Houses has outlawed religious ceremonies in the land,
        although both the Zaru slaves and members of the Houses often participate in
        odd cults, especially the Revenant Cult.

        Ammeni are the ever-popular antagonists of Near. In fact, their greatest theme
        in my eyes is redemption: how might this culture be justified or cured? Much of
        my original work on Ammeni in the following chapters revolves around this
        theme.
      %p
        Ammeni makes a very good milieu for steamy, passionate stories of human folly,
        sex and violence. This sort of story, called a BLOOD OPERA, is very good as a
        first introduction to the game for a group that doesn’t want to work with an
        adventuring premise. A blood opera operates on the premise that player
        characters are set up from the beginning to have clear, passionate goals that
        conflict with each other and those of other characters in the setting; this is
        very easy and natural in Ammeni, perhaps contributing to its popularity.

          Ammeni characters and stories set in Ammeni can go to some very dark places.
          The rules on conflict propriety from the SOLAR SYSTEM are important in defining
          the LINES that will not be crossed in the game content, as is common sense
          communication among the group; there’s no need to play awful events when they
          can be paraphrased in abstract, drawing a VEIL over the details.
        %p
          I have an important message for character players here, one that I often have
          to teach to new roleplayers: protagonism is not a guaranteed right, it can be
          lost. The easiest way to do so is to have your character act without
          understandable human motivation. In the immoral Ammeni it is easy for your
          character to trivialize the suffering of others; if you trivialize it as well,
          the other players will come to dislike the way you play and doubt your
          commitment to the fiction. They’ll try to play around it and take your
          character seriously, but if it seems that he’s just committing atrocities
          because you want attention or don’t care, it doesn’t come off very well.
        %p
          What the above means is: if your character does horrible things, you as the
          player should acknowledge it and accord the moment with the gravity it
          deserves. If the other players are taking the fiction seriously, they won’t
          like it if you don’t respect the endeavor equally.

        Ammeni is not, properly speaking, a nation; it is a cartel. It does not have
        citizens or nationals; even the individual Houses do not – they only have
        members.
      %p
        A member of a House is an interesting character because he or she might be
        steeped in cruelty, but still be a human being. How does that work? Is there a
        tension?
      %p
        The lower rungs of the House organizations have less and less stake in the
        endeavor that is Ammeni, thus making them more and more likely to have their
        own interests outside the House life. Or the middle-management might just be
        hungry and ambitious, ready to impress their masters by being even more
        ruthless than the next guy.
      %p
        Women of the Houses are usually very equal with the men, and twice as
        poisonous. The contrast is stark, as women in general are treated as property

        The Ammeni relationship with their slaves is an interesting topic, as it can
        range from pure victimization for gratification to uncaring practicality to a

        Theirs is a land of many minorities and cultures, however, so in practice their
        language sounds exotic to those from Maldor, including foreign clicks and
        accents.

          pretend to. House members use the name of the House, possibly barreled with a
          second name indicating their House branch. While House members are “of the
          House” with de/du particles, House slaves are “House’s” with the -ae/-e(h)

      From the fertile ground of Ammeni grows the world's largest supply of drugs of
      all types. Recreational drugs, poisons, and great healing herbs all sprout up
      wildly throughout Ammeni. The most common of these is a flower called POITURE.
      White poiture is a powerful recreational drug, sending the user in a hazy
      dream-state where consciousness becomes very third-person and the sense of time
      grows elongated. Red poiture, a much rarer type, causes fevered activity,
      occasional rage, and a loss of concentration. Black poiture is known to give a
      much more potent high than white poiture, and has reputed healing powers, but
      causes death in small quantities.
    %p
      Between the cornucopia of herbs and significant studies of the inner workings
      of the body done by curious or disturbed Ammenites, healers are common here.
      Many healers find employment in Houses as personal doctors or torturers, and
      others become medics in the legions. Unaffiliated healers are harder to come
      by, and most leave Ammeni to wander, although a few stay behind to help the
      Zaru underground.

      Freelance poisoners, on the other hand, are a dime a dozen. They might change
      affiliation once a week. For this reason, the hardest job interview in Ammeni
      is for a chef position. Chefs are known to be the best poisoners, and getting a
      job in a House as one means being interviewed by the ruler of that House, as
      well as his staff, and perhaps his torturer.

        The simplest way of creating poisons, drugs and cures is to engage HERBALISM
        (R) (or even WOODCRAFT (R) with the SECRET OF HERBAL MEDICINE) in a simple
        Ability check and make an Effect of the result according to the normal rules:
        assuming that the herbalist found the right herbs, the player gets to write the
        Effect as he would. Later the player gets to spend the Effect as bonus dice on
        appropriate checks, just like any Effects. Suitable Effects in this regard
        include such as “Various psychotropes from the hills” and “Fever-curing herbs”
        – give it enough detail to be interesting and make clear what the preparation
        actually does.

            properties of both rare and common herbs useful for food, poisons, drugs and
            cures. The practitioner may even try his hand at cultivating herbs in
            controlled conditions. WOODCRAFT (R) is simple and shallow in comparison, the

            Ammeni alchemy is a cynical science with little in the way of preconceptions
            and expectations; the alchemist rarely expects anything, in good or ill. He
            does, however, usually believe in the immortality of the body, achievable by
            the enforced balance of bodily forces. This combination of passion and cold
            calculation has driven Ammeni alchemy to great heights among the adepts.
          %dt Cooking (I)
          %dd
            Ammeni are superb cooks, thanks to the rich array of spices and exotic
            ingredients their lands supply. While HOUSEWORK (R) may make tasty food,
            Cooking is a superior art. Of course, it is not a given that tasty food will be
            much of an issue in a given campaign. Cooking may also be used to deliver
            herbal and alchemical poisons orally.
          %dt Taste Poison (I)

            Ammeni learn to distinguish poisons and drugs by sight, smell and taste,
            which is useful in a land infested by dangerous plants and animals. The Ability
            might be used in creating and trading drugs, but most valued it is in avoiding
            poisoning. Normally a character would support his ENDURANCE (V) check against
            poison with this Ability, to see how much he imbibed before noticing the
            poison.

            The character knows how to create INFUSIONS, powerful alchemical concoctions.
            The alchemist pays a REASON cost for his infusion when it is created. Complex
            infusions take great skill to create: each stage past the first incurs a
            cumulative penalty die to the creation check. Cost: 1 REASON per stage past the
            first.

            failure ruins it. Each moved or removed stage causes a penalty die to this
            check. The funneling process may also be used to reverse engineer and master an
            infusion from another alchemist’s notes, although the Story Guide may mess with
            the exact composition and order of the stages during the process. Cost: 1

            (which they really aren’t). Often their effects are delayed by digestion
            unpredictably, and a victim might not even realize that they are being

            no maintenance cost.
          %dt Secret of Addiction (specify)
          %dd
            The character is addicted to the specified substance and will have trouble
            doing well unless satisfied regularly. The addiction affects one of the
            character’s Pools, causing normal Pool refreshment to return only one Pool
            point for the character. A full refill, instead, is gained by partaking of the
            addiction. However, this only works once per session, extra satisfaction only
            returns one Pool point per scene. (For multiple addictions in one Pool, all
            have to be satisfied for full satisfaction, but each can be satisfied
            independently for partial.) Addiction can be broken by long-term denial and
            RESIST (R) check, but the Secret remains and becomes active if the character
            ever indulges again; only extraordinary measures (a QUEST, say) can remove an
            addiction altogether.

            plan to cheat death. Buyoff: Endanger your life.

        ALCHEMY (R) is an alternative for this simple Effect-work: it is inferior in
        that it requires more expensive equipment and ingredients to get the same
        outcome, but for more complex work alchemy is mandatory: aside from the SECRET
        OF BOTANY simple natural cures cannot be leveraged much further. Alchemy can
        use mineral and animal materials as well as plants to work on, although Ammeni
        alchemy is traditionally almost exclusively based on Flora.
      %p
        When a herbal Effect is used in a hostile way, the victim is of course entitled
        to declaring a conflict. This might be a simple ENDURANCE (V) check against the
        poisoner’s ASSASSINATION (I) or COOKING (I), depending on how the poison is
        applied, with the Effect value as bonus dice for the poisoner. Normal conflict
        resolution in that regard.
      %p
        The next step in alchemy is distilling INFUSIONS, which is possible with the
        SECRET OF THE STILL. An infusion (the effective pharmaceutical substance
        suspended in a liquid such as grain alcohol) is also an Effect, but it is not
        normally consumed as bonus dice: instead, it represents the potency of the
        special formula the alchemist produces. When infusions are created, the
        alchemist creates one or more STAGES of the infusion, all of which may have
        different mechanical effects on the target. The first stage in Ammeni alchemy
        is always created with HERBALISM (R), while the other stages are normally
        created with ALCHEMY (R); the player makes the appropriate Ability checks for
        each stage in a support chain. Should a stage fail, the whole concoction is
        ruined. The alchemist may opt to end the process at any stage, or continue to
        make the infusion even more powerful.
      %p
        For each successful stage in the distillation process, one STAGE EFFECT from
        the following list is chosen; the Story Guide chooses the first stage according
        to dramatic coordination; afterwards the player (or players, if several are
        involved) and the Story Guide take turns, with the Story Guide messing or
        cooperating with the process as he would. Depending on the details of the
        process and the available resources of the alchemist, individual stages may
        have to be delayed to procure some special tools or materials (or even replaced
        by checks of TRADE ROUTES (R), WEALTH (R) or BARTER (I)); the Story Guide
        interprets the fictional details as necessary. The player may also freely delay
        the work for refreshment or do other things on the side, provided he keeps
        notes of the progress.

            value minus the check difference in Harm.
          %li

            Heighten or dull senses causes the stage of the effect in bonus or penalty

            penalty dice with unexpected stimulation, such as bright sunlight or loud
            noise.
          %li
            Addiction is a common effect, often introduced by the Story Guide into
            appropriate drugs. The recipient of the drug makes an ENDURANCE (V) check
            against the Effect value; on failure he pays the stage of the effect in Reason
            or takes the appropriate SECRET OF ADDICTION.
        %p
          The player gives a name to the completed infusion, creates an Effect (for free)
          out of the last Ability check in the process and writes down the stage effects
          in order. The overall outcome looks somewhat like the examples to the right.
        %p
          When an infusion is applied (orally or injected), the target makes an ENDURANCE
          (V) check against the Effect: on a success last stages of the Effect equal to
          the check difference do not activate, while on failure all stages activate and
          the character suffers the check difference as Harm. On a tie, obviously, all
          stages take effect and no Harm is caused.
        %p
          The infusion Effect is not particularly consumed by using it (unless using the
          FRAGILE EFFECTS variant rule, of course); the Effect represents the on-going
          efforts of the alchemist in creating and preserving his stock of the infusion.
          The Effect may be destroyed by divesting the alchemist of his stock, notes and
          tools, using normal rules for destroying Effects. The Effect may not be
          directly duplicated by another character per se, but the alchemists can of
          course help each other reproduce experiments.

          When infusions are used in conflict, sometimes the issue is not whether the
          character can endure the horrid poison, but whether it is successfully injected
          in the first place. My take on this is that I don’t necessarily allow the
          victim a conflict over the issue; a character needs to be aware of the
          possibility of poison, otherwise it is a simple unopposed check of
          ASSASSINATION (I) or some other Ability for the poisoner to slip it to him. An
          aware target may often use REACT (I) or a more elaborate Ability to avoid the
          spray, needle, or whatever implement the poisoner would use.

            The character has learned a new stage effect to include in his infusions:
            Healing infusions still may cause Harm, but they also hasten recovery from
            appropriate Harm. Remove one Harm of at most the Effect level of the infusion.
            A healing stage may only occur on stages divisible by three.
      %p
        That last part is a bit frivolous, but I’m demonstrating a technique: a stage
        effect may be limited to appearing only at certain stages of the infusion to

        reliable, but weaker one.

            Travel infusions allow the recipient to visit faraway places in spirit. The

        create a drug that does the same thing by combining UNCONSCIOUSNESS and
        HEIGHTENING SENSES; a creative reading makes applying crunch exciting, which is
        good, because that’s where the fun is supposed to be.

      Near after the Skyfire is in a state of disintegration. No civilization has
      survived such a calamity intact, ever. Many individual communities are
      isolated, with their knowledge bases slowly eroding and value systems
      convulsing, knotting up like a wounded animal dying in a deep burrow.
    %p
      The long southern coastline of the Sea of Teeth is sparsely populated. Vaguely
      Khalean marsh tribes and roving bands of hunterbandits eke out a primitive
      living that gets worse every year as the communities prey on each other.
      Villagers from neighboring valleys do not understand each other’s speech; the
      old roads are all but gone; specialized knowledge is replaced by the common
      necessities of survival.
    %p
      No nation of Near is able to survive alone, but neither do the borders seem
      surmountable. Things are even worse on the eastern coasts, and nobody really
      knows what savagery is happening in the interior wilderness nobody has visited
      for a generation.

      It is a questionable hope, but the caravans and trade ships of Ammeni are the
      first touch of the larger world to many isolated communities that have

        The merchant princes of the Houses are exalted beings in this day and age. They
        wield wealth that is not only all but monetized, but greater than any one man
        could ever hope to consume. They have capital, a concept near unknown in great
        parts of Near. This is a condition that allows the princes unprecedented
        options in elevating and ruining themselves and others.
      %p
        This wealth is not trivial to create. The SECRET OF FORTUNE is extraordinary
        and mechanically challenging to create. A character wanting it needs to use
        SECRET OF QUEST to execute a business plan of some sort or get the fortune from
        another character, willingly or not. My take is that I allow at most one

            nearly so. It's useful for hiding wealth, trading it, turning it into money,

            The character has more than any one person could ever need. The form of the
            wealth might be specific or ever-changing, depending on the character. Any
            material Effects he chooses to garner by wealth come to him effortlessly,
            without Pool cost. Similarly, he pays a Pool point instead of an Advance to
            wield mundane equipment that can be bought. The only limitations to this are
            practical, such as time and availability; the Story Guide might consider one
            application per scene a good rule of thumb on this. The Ability used in the
            procurement of Effects and equipment is WEALTH (R), unless the task is left to
            a suitably skilled client. The character still pays Effect upkeep on refreshes
            for any Effects he chooses to maintain, and he has to invest the Advance to
            keep any equipment at the end of the session. Cost: 1 VIGOR to use mundane

        The Ammeni plantation industry is predicated on cheap human labor. They do not
        hesitate to enslave new peoples when opportunity arises, and they encourage
        their stock to breed in captivity to increase the wealth. Bred slaves are
        prized, and the institution certainly has its painful and uncomfortable
        moments: Ammeni culture as a whole does not have an over-arching legal theory
        for slavery, so often a person’s status as a slave or a free man is a matter of
        opinion, resolved by the people present and how they view the claimant to
        freedom: deeds of ownership are usually honored by the Houses, as well as
        brands and other such marks, but lacking those leaves the putative slave-owner
        with little but his own strength to enforce his claim. Only Zaru, goblins and
        similar distinctive subject peoples are presumed slaves without further proof;
        the only issue with them is finding the legal owner.
      %p
        It is important to distinguish that while slaves often have little mechanical
        impact to what happens in individual scenes of the game, this is not because
        they do not have individuality, value or purpose as human beings to us; rather,
        we deal with a bunch of plantation slaves exactly the way we would deal with a
        bunch of guardsmen or free peasants or nobility at a soiree: as extras who
        don’t have direct impact on this particular story as long as we choose not to
        look closer.
      %p
        Specifically, when the SECRET OF SLAVERY says that slaves always perform with
        MEDIOCRE (0) Ability when conflicting for their master, this is not to say that
        slaves in the setting are always non-remarkable in every way; rather, the
        relationship of the slave to his master deprotagonizes him when it comes to the
        master’s goals. The same slave might turn around and act as a MASTER (3) in the
        very same scene, should he have reason to act for himself as a human being
        instead of as a tool for another.

        Ammeni law is set by the Council of Houses first and foremost to facilitate
        trade. Although some other things are touched upon when the Houses act in
        agreement, trade is the common priority. What’s more, the authority of the
        Council in this role is accepted with surprising sincerity by the Ammeni: free
        traders do not lightly renege on a fair deal between unencumbered traders, even
        as the cynical princes of the Houses follow the law as a convenience only.
      %p
        Ammeni trade law makes clear distinction between House trade and independent
        speculative endeavors; the differentiation is essential, because the
        preferential trade clauses commonly used in treating with trade partners are
        only enforceable in House trade; meanwhile independent trade is free from
        having to defend stapling and market rights from falling to disuse. In practice
        this arrangement means that while internal and well-established trade routes in
        Ammeni are carefully allotted as House monopolies by precedent and their
        ability to demonstrably service the trade, the same Houses compete with the
        most adventurous independent merchants when it comes to speculative trade.
      %p
        Ammeni trade law divides trade privileges conceptually into MARKET RIGHTS and
        ROUTE RIGHTS. The former concern rights connected to local control of
        territory: for example, the right of House trading depots to inspect and delay
        travel through the depot, most often situated in a waterway access of some
        sort. This might also involve rights of first offer or mandatory market
        participation by any merchants passing through the depot. In Ammeni lands only
        Houses hold market rights, while elsewhere Ammeni traders have to negotiate for
        these rights with the local rulers; typically a House trader would set up an
        enclave within an existing settlement or start a new trade station in the area
        after negotiating for exclusive rights to conducting the local market. Such
        rights would then be enforced against other traders with the help of the local
        ruler. It is entirely conceivable for an Ammeni trade master of this sort to
        eclipse the wealth and authority of whatever local ruler his position depends
        on.
      %p
        Route rights are involved in a different way, as they range from trade secrets
        to legally enforced monopolies. A speculative trade route increases in value
        greatly after it has been proved feasible by successful exploration. At this
        point the route does not have any protection aside from obscurity. However, a
        House that conducts regular trade along a specific trade route and improves it
        with waystation arrangements may in time claim ownership over it; such
        ownership over an abstract trade route is not legally enforceable against
        foreigners, but the Houses themselves do not compete on routes claimed by other
        Houses in this manner. Independent Ammeni traders might or might not respect
        route claims; if caught, however, they lose negotiation privileges for right of
        passage and trade in the lands and markets of the particular House, which would
        often be a crippling blow for an independent trader: all Houses hold
        established steadings on the Poison River, which any may bar against trade at
        their own cut-off point.
      %p
        The Ammeni trade law is in many ways orthogonal to old civil law of the Empire,
        and in many ways its direct opposite. This is no constraint to the Ammeni
        traders, who follow their own laws in their own land and no law at all anywhere
        else, unless forced to it by a local power.

        That’s the socialistic narrative, anyway: merchant princes wield enormous
        power, which is counteracted by human decency. The alternative reading is that

        Either way, it is a good idea to tie merchant characters and their business
        onto issues of human identity; the character is easy to leave shallow if his

      Zaru was once rich. Her soil is extremely fertile and rice, swamp apples, and
      other crops grow bountifully. Zaru's greatest asset became her downfall,
      though: the language of ZU, the language of creation, spread beyond her borders
      and infected the world. Zu is not like other languages; it is magical, and
      anyone hearing it can then use it themselves. Moreover, speaking it actually
      wills actions, circumstances, and objects into being.
    %p
      Because of zu's ability to infect others' minds, the Maldorite Emperor Absolon
      used it to cement his empire by making it the universal language of his people.
      When the knowledge of zu spread, the people of the world misused it, not
      understanding its power. Many people believe the use of it caused the great Sky
      Fire, and the subsequent destruction of the old world.

        After the Moon rose, Zu became broken. Now the people long used to peace had no
        means of defending themselves. By nature, the Zaru are pacifists, finding no
        need for violence with their terrible gifts. As they emerged back into the
        world, they found themselves overpowered by the Ammenites, who had long before
        envied the fertility of the Zaru delta. Zaru's people were taken as slaves and
        made to work in the worst sort of hot, steamy, swampy conditions.
      %p
        As a people, the Zaru are fairly uniform in appearance. Black hair is virtually
        homogenous among them, and their skin is dusky, their eyes dark. If they look
        like a modern-day people of Earth, those people would come straight out of
        Southeast Asia, complete with loose-fitting clothes and large, flat hats made
        to keep the burning sun off them when toiling in the fields.
      %p
        As a nation, Zaru does not exist any more. Ammeni truly has dominated it, and
        Zaru villages exist on Ammenite plantations, under the care of foremen. Typical
        construction is made of bamboo, and communities exist around “speaking halls,”
        long buildings in which the Zaru eat, cook, converse, and often sleep. Only the
        elders of a community and their adult children have the privilege of living in
        tiny huts built around the speaking hall. Older villages, pre-Shadow, do exist
        in Zaru, which are basically larger versions of their slave villages: large
        speaking halls with family houses built around the central building. These are
        usually constructed of hard, baked clay around a bamboo center, and are
        incredibly durable. As insurgency has grown in Zaru, some radical groups have
        fled to the old towns and formed their bases of operations there.
      %p
        Families are very important in traditional Zaru culture. They are viewed as
        “mini-villages,” with the eldest person being the leader of that family.
        (Pre-Shadow Zaru houses bear this out, as they are usually built as a long room
        spanning the house, with small rooms for the elders built off of this.)
        Villages are built around the same structure, with the eldest person in village
        taking the role of priest and leader, as they have seen more and heard more
        than anyone else. The Ammenites are well aware of this, and break up families
        and villages by sending children inland and working the elderly to an early
        death. One underground movement in Zaru returns babies to their mothers in the
        dark night, traveling far over land to switch them back.

        The zu phrase for an Ammenite is “land-thief,” an appropriate epithet for a

      %p
        “Word-thief” is a term given to a non-Zaru that uses the sacred tongue of zu,
        especially Ammenite sorcerers. Zaru elders are torn on how to deal with the
        resurgence of zu and its potent virulence. The majority of them, who grew up
        with stories about when zu was taken away, agree that it should not be used,
        thereby keeping it firmly - but uselessly – in Zaru hands. The younger
        generation doesn't completely agree: there is a strong underground movement to
        rebel against the Ammenites using any means necessary.

        Killers and especially the radical MOONMEN priesthood are called
        “blood-thieves”. It is not just that they are willing to spill blood; the
        actions of the radical freedom fighters reverberate in the world and cause
        outsiders to bring violence to Zaru villages. Elders consider this a crime just
        as much as having blood on your own hands.

        Non-aggression and pacifism are fundamental cornerstones of the Zaru existence.
        They are also what binds the people to their servitude and makes them the
        preferred slave stock for their Ammeni masters.
      %p
        Resistance comes in a multitude of forms: for example, the priesthood of Hanish
        has released a martial art for the slaves, called UPTENBO or
        “life-shield-hand”. It is non-lethal but powerful, concentrating on redirection
        of force and incapacitation of the opponent. Uptenbo is not just a martial art,
        but a philosophy that strives to teach the frustrated Zaru to turn their
        weakness into a non-violent strength on the face of the enslaver. It is taught
        secretly, disguised as dance.
      %p
        A martial art such as Uptenbo consists of a number of TECHNIQUES. Techniques
        are just Secrets that are further referenced by other Secrets, such as the
        PUMSA, intensively trained fighting combinations that strive to overcome an
        enemy without giving him a chance to react. The opponent of a pumsa can break
        the sequence by preventing the character from performing the next technique,
        which might be done by various means, but at least a REACT (I) check to dodge
        whatever the opposing fighter is doing should work. Pumsa are normally used in
        extended conflict over several rounds, but a smart group can apply them
        feasibly in other mechanical contexts as well.
      %p
        (Although I don’t usually term fighting techniques from other cultures as such,
        they are still TECHNIQUES in the mechanical sense. Feel free to experiment.)
      %p
        The philosophy of pacifism is rooted deep in the culture of Uptenbo, the
        masters of which believe in not only the moral superiority of non-violence, but
        its actual strategic superiority: one day they will free Zaru by demonstrating
        to the conqueror that the people will not, cannot be swayed to cooperate any
        longer. Whatever happens then, the land will once again be free.

      %p
        An important Story Guiding principle for a solidly slavery-focused campaign is
        this: do not take the institution of slavery, in farming or personal servitude,
        as a standardized proposition to which all characters should have easy
        snap-shot judgments prepared. Life doesn’t work that way.
      %p
        The above is important for the idea I’ve already floated earlier: the Story
        Guide should engage in enabling play. Thus, when a player tells you that his
        character is going to steal away and go explore inside the master’s villa to
        find that girl he took a fancy on, the correct response is not “of course all
        slaves are branded or memorized by face or watched by foremen all the time,
        that’s what it means to be a slave, right?” Rather, consider the opposite
        reality in your judgment: for the slave economy to function at all, there must
        be a certain degree of participation and cooperation, however enforced, from
        the slave population. This in turn means that a character willing to risk
        punishment might very well have a considerable freedom of action on his side,
        at least until he is noticed as a troublemaker by the foreman.
      %p
        To choose another tack, consider the Ammeni slave masters and their attitudes.
        It would be easy to presume that for them to uphold the institution of slavery
        at all, they’ll all have to be remorseless monsters that will of course never
        care a bit about what a slave has to say. A more moderate (and again, more
        realistic) viewpoint is to presume that many Ammeni are not directly exposed to
        the more savage facets of their economy, and thus are emotionally utterly
        unprepared to face the reality. For this sort of character it is far from
        unlikely that a player character could influence them through pity, even if the
        player character happened to be a slave.
      %p
        What those examples are trying to say is, once again, simple: do not
        deprotagonize and disable player characters just because of your own
        preconceptions about how powerless they should be. Rely on the conflict
        resolution system to make these judgments for you.

      Zu is more than a language to the Zaru; it is also a religion. The beliefs of
      the Zaru people can best be described as “spiritual humanism.” They believe zu
      is the language that was used to create the world by the First Man, and that
      all humans are his descendants, all divine. When the first murder occurred, zu
      was corrupted, as murder is destruction, the antithesis of what humans were

        on proper zu usage and Zaru unity. One group believes that all Zu should be
        kept firmly in the hands of Zaru, specifically elders, thereby keeping the
        unwise from using it, and denying their enemies a potent weapon. This group,
        the WATCHERS, train young rebels to work as “word-horses”, adventurers who
        steal zu from non-Zaru, or Zaru using it unwisely, and bring those zu back to
        their priests. This group is committed to the Zaru way of non-violence, but
        some fringe sects have seen fit to use foreign mercenaries to carry words.

        The SONS OF HANISH follow a more moderate path. They seek to follow Hanish and
        be an active force in the world, while staying true to their beliefs. This
        group operates in cells, which are based on the family “mini-village”
        structure, and attempts to change the situation of the Zaru by subtle actions,
        like using zu to influence a foreman to keep a family together, or causing a
        crop to do well or poorly.
      %p
        The MOONMEN are the most radical of the Zaru priesthoods, and are the most
        diverse. While the Sons of Hanish are mainly young and male, and the Watchers
        older, the Moonmen are made up of brash youngsters, lunatic elderly, calm
        mothers, and even foreigners. They advocate nothing more than a full unleashing
        of Zaru power. Nonviolence is taken only on a personal basis among them, and
        they have no real structure. Instead, individual Moonmen tend to upset the
        cart, often putting the community in a worse situation, and spread their
        beliefs among those pressured enough to listen. It is said that the Moonmen
        count among their ranks at least one elf and several goblins. More conservative
        Zaru call these “blood-thieves”, both for their subversion of the normal Zaru

            knows whether he needs to add more syllables to gain the effect he desires. The
            player also can negate the utterance without effect if the desired outcome is
            not reached. Finally, if he has time, the character may make a ZU (R) check in
            advance to get the Story Guide to judge on the likely outcome of a sentence of
            up to the check result in syllables. The player may write down such a judgment
            as an Effect, which makes it binding for as long as the Effect is retained.

            If the character kills (or is present at the death of) the keeper of a Zu
            syllable, he can obtain it himself: make a ZU (R) check to capture syllables up
            to the check result in number from the dying essence. Pay Advances normally.
            Cost: 1 INSTINCT per captured syllable. Requirement: SECRET OF UZ
          %dt Key of the Sorcerer
          %dd
            The character is a SORCERER, committed to obtaining and understanding zu. 1xp:
            Gain intelligence about a new word. 2xp: Figure out some more Zu grammar or
            syntax. 5xp: Obtain a new word. Buyoff: Willingly give away a zu.
          %dt Key of the Word-Horse
          %dd
            The Watchers have empowered the character to seek and steal back zu that lies
            in the wrong hands. 1xp: Progress with the task. 2xp: Steal to do the job. 5xp:
            Return zu to a Watcher. Buyoff: Steal wrongfully, or kill.
          %dt Key of the Chatterbox
          %dd
            The character is not very patient and will use Zu with little provocation. 1xp:

      %p
        What of Zu, then? It is a language with a relatively simple structure, easy to
        learn even after it has become broken. However, the same simplicity breeds
        ambiguity, making mastering zu a task for a lifetime. Zu is made up of discrete
        syllables, each with a generalized meaning. These syllables are also words;
        complex ideas are built by combining several. Syllables each have three
        meanings, based on tone:
      %ul.simple
        %li Nouns have mid-tone, or no tone.
        %li Verbs have low tone.
        %li Modifiers have high tone.
      %p
        The syllables, depending on tone, mean each of these things; thus no syllable
        exists in zu that cannot be used as a noun, verb, and modifier. Pronouns are
        implied by context and body language. Some examples of syllables:

            %td stalk
            %td stealthy
      %p
        Sentences, as modern-day speakers think of them, exist by combining syllables.
        The last syllable used in a sentence conveys the mode. A sentence ending in a
        noun is a statement of fact, meaning “this exists” or “this is so”. A sentence
        ending in a verb is a command, even if it refers to the speaker: the speaker is
        stating her action and in essence, commanding herself. A sentence ending in a
        modifier is optative: it expresses hope or desire for change, meaning “I wish
        that it was like this”.
      %p
        As mentioned, syllables are for general terms, not specific. There is no one
        syllable for “tiger”, for example. “Tiger” would be spoken as
        “knife-tooth-hunter-beast”. Another example would be “sword”, which is said as
        “killing-knife”. If a zu speaker does not use multiple syllables to be
        specific, then the most appropriate meaning is assumed. For example, if a
        speaker says “beast” in a forest, he means “forest animal”; if he were to say
        the same syllable in a snake pit, he means snake. If he were to say “knife” to
        a farmer and a hunter, he would again mean different things – most likely a
        scythe and a hunting knife.
      %p
        There is one syllable in zu that is not like any other: “zu”. “Zu” is an
        affirmation, an agreement. Originally, there was no opposite, no “no” in zu.
        (True Zaru never speak in the negative: if there is nothing affirmative to say,
        they do not speak in zu.) With the first act of murder, however, that changed.
        The murderer, the destroyer, lost his ability to speak the syllable “zu.”
        Instead, he spoke the syllable “uz” a word of disagreement and destruction. No
        person can say both “zu” and “uz”.

      %h3
        %a#theft-of-zu{:name => "theft-of-zu"} Theft of Zu
      %p
        Originally, anyone who spoke zu could use it as words of power. Stating that
        something was so made it so; commanding someone compelled them; wishing for
        different circumstances brought them into being. With Hanish's final chant,
        this changed. He brought all the power of zu into himself, recreating himself
        as the First Man. Suddenly, the Zaru lost their power, as their language became
        ordinary and impotent.
      %p
        Hanish died that day, but the power of zu did not die with him. Instead, it
        changed forever. The power of a syllable could be harnessed, but only by one
        person at a time. Anyone who studies zu can speak it, but only those who are
        the master of a syllable can use it to enforce their will. Now, Zaru priests,
        outcasts, and foreigners vie to obtain the knowledge of these words.
      %p
        The words of power are first awakened within a person when he hears them used:
        the SECRET OF ZU (or UZ) is learned only when the words are uttered in a
        character’s presence. Some grasp it at once, some never, to some it comes
        against their will. The danger of using zu around other people is that they may
        steal the knowledge of a syllable. When a word is uttered, anyone who hears it
        can engage the speaker in a battle of wills to own the knowledge of that word.
        Only ZU (and again, UZ) itself may be mastered by all.
      %p
        Mechanically speaking, anyone with an Advance to spend (two Advances if they
        lack the SECRET OF ZU) may engage an immediate conflict of ZU (R) against ZU
        (R) to wrest the word from its current owner when it is uttered. Should the
        transference succeed, the owner regains an Advance while the thief pays for the
        word.
      %p
        Words may also be given willingly, in which case no Advances are spent or
        recovered. In all other ways Zu syllables are handled as Secrets.

      %p
        When a character with the SECRET OF ZU and some mastered syllables uses the
        power, the mechanical effect depends on the mode of the utterance:

        %h4
          %a#declarative{:name => "declarative"} Declarative
        %p
          A noun utterance wills things into being. The player spends a point of REASON
          for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (R) check. Anybody else present
          reflexively RESISTS (R) the event (creating support chains if they want).
          Should the speaker succeed (nobody resists successfully, rather), the thing
          summoned appears nearby. If animate, the summoned thing is not under any
          particular control of the summoner.

          A verb utterance is a command, forcing the target to obey. The player spends a
          point of INSTINCT for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (I) check. The
          target may RESIST (R) freely, and in any case the command only works if the
          target can hear the speaker. (Understanding the language is not an issue, words
          of power are always understood by all.) Impossible tasks may not be compelled,
          and the player of the target interprets the command. Long-lasting tasks only
          continue for several scenes if the character makes an Effect off the check
          result.

        %h4
          %a#optative{:name => "optative"} Optative
        %p
          The utterance of a modifier changes circumstances of action. Modifiers may
          affect both people and things, both positively and negatively. The player
          spends a point of VIGOR for each syllable uttered and makes a ZU (V) check. The
          result of the check is used as either bonus or penalty dice towards any targets
          that are affected, or optionally turned into an Effect if the change in
          circumstance is lasting. The intended influence of the utterance need not be
          direct: a wind exhorted to blow faster may cause penalty dice to fall on the
          captain of a ship, for example.
        %p
          Note how the associated Pool of ZU changes depending on the mode of the
          utterance. The Ability checks made to utter a word may suffer conditional
          penalties assigned by the Story Guide normally; Zu is more difficult when
          large-scale changes are invoked, so summoning large things (or many things),
          commanding many people or changing circumstances in a wide area is more
          difficult.
        %p
          Ambiguity of utterances plays a key role in Zu – the players know what
          individual syllables roughly mean, but when words are invoked for power, the
          Story Guide always judges the actual outcome of the utterance based on the
          context, word-play and dramatic coordination. Thus the syllable “cat” serves
          just fine when the character just wants a feline, but if he needs a big and
          dangerous predator, then “fang-cat” or “big-cat” or even “big-fang-cat” is much
          better. Getting some actual control over the invocation is pretty much the only
          reason to ever pay more than one Pool point for a single Zu invocation.
        %p
          As for Story Guide judgment, in actual play I’m usually not too hard-ass about
          zu. It is a power that is fundamentally not controlled by its invoker, and may
          thus turn against him, but outright adverse effects should be saved for when an
          alternate reading of the uttering is either really funny or more obvious than
          what the player intended. If the players make a point of using 2-3 syllables on
          important invocations instead of trying to get by too cheaply, the Story Guide
          is doing fine. Think of it like interpreting wish spells in DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS:
          it’s most fun when both the invoker and the Story Guide take the word-play with
          flair and understand that the magic the character is using is an unruly beast.

        Traditionally lists of zu don’t provide the actual syllables, only the
        translations we use. This book doesn’t use many zu syllables; UP, TEN and BO
        are probably the most prominent after ZU itself. This does not mean that we
        don’t use made-up syllables in actual play; we certainly do, it’s just that we
        establish whatever syllables we want when and if they’re needed.
      %p
        I’ve included a long list of suitable zu words here because it’s something
        people tend to ask after when it comes to actual play. Thinking up words can be
        hard, but just like all other contents in this book, don’t let my words
        constrain you: your zu can be different, or it might be that zu includes many
        ways of structuring the same concept. Just because I might connect
        \&lt;person|speak|humane&gt; doesn’t mean you can’t use &lt;person|love|passionate&gt;, or
        even both words. The important thing is for you to choose the small set of
        syllables that you actually use in your campaign to reflect your own
        understanding of the primal society and culture of Zaru. Presumably the things
        easiest to express (individual syllables) are also those that reflect the state

        Typical Ability SPECIALIZATIONS for Khaleans include camouflage, drinking,
        jests, growing herbs, tracking, theatre, sailing, craft specialties, moiety
        responsibilities.
      %p
        Typical Pool CONDITIONING for Khaleans comes from bardic upbringing or
        surviving alone in the wilds.
      %p
        Typical Ability ENHANCEMENTS for Khaleans originate in ancestral blessings,
        heroic inspiration, foreign magic.
      %p
        Typical Ability SYNERGIES for Khaleans are common abilities with their Khalean
        counterparts.

        Typical EQUIPMENT for Khaleans is wooden, including spears, swords, bows,
        shields, boats. Other things include clothing off leather and plants, craft
        tools, musical instruments, exotic animals, hero bands.
    %p
      Across the Border Sea, the deep green peninsula of Khale is an echo of Qek's
      lushness. Once a stone's throw across the Hungry River from Qek, the
      earthquakes of the Time of Shadow have split it away as the river was ripped
      into the much larger Sea of Teeth. It is still close: the Dragon's Mouth is a
      small strait between Khale and Qek, and is usually much calmer than the sea.
      Controlling this strait, as well as a mysterious substance called moon-metal,
      earns Khale the enmity of its southern neighbor, Ammeni, who has attacked the
      country in a war of attrition for several years.
    %p
      The forests of Khale are wet and thick, but move from jungle to evergreen
      woodlands, dappled with sunlight. They are sacred to the people of Khale who
      live beneath their towering boughs. Everything a tribesman could need is found
      under the forest-top, from fields of mushrooms and plants for medicine and
      food, to deer to hunt and ride, to fallen tree limbs easily sap-cured into bows
      and spears. Before the Time of Shadow, great webbed cities connected the
      forest; since then, the remnants of tribes live only off the land.
    %p
      Khale is a harsh land in which to live: its many rivers flow with the blood of
      cousins, as the many tribes fight for control of their own land, and Ammeni
      pushes its troops further north. The land rumbles as many chieftains try to
      unite the tribes, but so far, none have been successful.

      %p
        Khaleans are a hearty and strong people, Mediterranean in appearance, with
        generally black, brown, or red hair, and green or brown eyes. They claim
        ancient heritage with the people of Qek and maintain good relations with the
        few Qek that emerge from the jungle, although they speak different languages.
      %p
        Khaleans operate in tribes of two to ten dozen people and consider all tribe
        members to be their family, not just blood relations. In fact, blood brothers
        from different tribes are not considered to be related at all, except in the
        way that all Khaleans are related. Upon marriage, males join the tribe of their
        wife, becoming part of a new family.
      %p
        In addition, outsiders, or those with no family, can become part of the tribe
        through a naming ritual.
      %p
        Within the tribe, status is very important. While family lines are matriarchal,
        positions of power are dominated by men. The tribe's chief is almost always
        male, the husband of the eldest woman in the tribe, and his advisors, usually a
        bard and his most accomplished warrior, are also men. When two tribes battle,
        it is Khalean law – that is, tradition as old as Khale – that only the tribe's
        men can fight. If a woman were found to be fighting for a tribe, it would be a
        horrible disgrace, and that tribe would more than likely surrender the fight.

      %p
        The forests of Khale are worshiped as ancestors. Each tree in a tribe's
        territory is believed to be a fallen member of the tribe, born again as part of
        the land. An ancient and legendary tree in the center of Khale is said to be
        the great King Khale, a ruler that united all of the peninsula and lands
        beyond, and the father of all modern Khaleans.
      %p
        Religion revolves around festivals, gatherings where a tribe – or many friendly
        tribes – will gather for a many-day-long revelry and celebration of their past.
        All festivals have tellings of great tales about the ancestors, done ritually
        around a bonfire. These rituals are competitive as tribal priests or BARDS try
        to outdo each other with fantastic stories. The bards, part priest and part
        artist, are given a special place in Khalean culture, as they are immune to
        normal tribal conflicts. When two tribes clash, the bards of each tribe will
        meet to write down the story of the conflict, narrating it as the battle flows.
        Killing a bard is a criminal offense, and usually results in the death of the
        murderer.
      %p
        Magic is fully accepted in Khale, and fascinates most people. The bards of
        Khale, and foreign sorcerers (called DRUIDS by the Khaleans) are highly
        respected and use magic freely. It is said that each bard learns three PERFECT
        CHORDS in his lifetime; which three seems to reflect life experience in a
        profound manner. The chords are normal Secrets, except that obtaining them can
        be somewhat arduous: SECRET OF QUEST may be used to sidestep requirements.
        Musical effects may, of course, be RESISTED (R) by the audience at will.

        %a#the-green-world{:name => "the-green-world"} The Green World
      %p
        Inside the forests of Khale, there is another world, a mystic world. This is
        their greatest secret, and it is forbidden to share it with those not of the
        tribe. Ancient trees, those with a circumference greater than two men holding
        hands, can be used as a gateway into the GREEN WORLD.
      %p
        This Green World is a maze of pathways, some so small that one must crawl
        through them, and others large enough for five people to stand side-by-side.
        The walls of these caverns are growing wood, light and grainy, and glow with
        faint green light. When the Sky Fire came, many Khaleans moved into the Green
        World to escape, building cities inside its immense caverns. Those cities lie
        dead now, and are said to be haunted; gnarled trees grow throughout them, with
        human expressions twisted into their trunks.
      %p
        The Green World covers all of Khale, and can be used as a passageway to
        anywhere else in the land, provided there is a guide. When one ends up is less
        certain: while experienced travelers have little trouble, those who get lost in
        the Green World may find themselves exiting into another time entirely. Bards
        sometime use these passages to go to earlier times and talk to ancient
        ancestors, although no one has ever been able to travel within one hundred
        years before the Time of Shadow, or one year after it.
      %p
        Legends say that King Khale himself still wanders these halls, a large old man
        with a beard like moss, and hands like wood-knots. Supposedly, he or other
        great ancestors can guide you to any place and time within these halls, or
        grant you great boons, provided you perform a quest, usually a reenactment of a
        previous adventure of the ancestor. During festivals, tribes will sometimes
        send their greatest hero bands to perform a quest and grant them success over
        their enemies. As war envelopes Khale from the south, some tribes have moved
        completely into the Green World, leaving the land of Khale behind. Their great
        mistake lies in the fact that the Green World does not stand alone: it is
        formed of the forest of Khale, and as the forest falls, it grows dimmer and
        smaller.

          The Green World is difficult to traverse. My strategy is to handle it almost
          like the Qek jungle (chapter 14): a bard familiar with the terrain may well
          learn knots from the ancestors or even tie them himself, becoming a TSAFARI
          (known in Khale simply as questors). The pertinent Ability in the Green World
          is TREE-BOND (I). Typical knots would involve gateways into different places
          and times, important ancestors and waypoints of ancestral quests.
        %p
          Characters unfamiliar with the pathways may still check TREEBOND (I) to avoid
          danger and encounter friendly ancestors, as their instincts lead them. Just
          like the Qek jungles, getting lost is an invitation for the Story Guide to
          complicate things, not to end the story.

        Within tribes, farming and hunting are both fine jobs and craftsmen and artists

        carve strong tools and weapons from wood, curing them with sap, is legendary.
      %p
        Tribes are communal entities divided internally into MOIETIES or “skin groups”,
        sort of totemic factions named for common animals that are entangled with both
        means of production and procreation: while a person’s moiety does not directly
        determine their occupation, it does indicate his responsibility of oversight
        over the work of others in the commune. Moieties for individuals are determined
        based on the moieties of their parents as well as their gender; the foremost
        purpose is prevention of incest, which is achieved by strict taboos in
        determining which moieties are allowed to marry each other.
      %p
        Khale trades for metal tools with Qek, and their longships sail to southern
        Maldor to trade spices which do not grow in that colder climate. Many young
        Khalean men, bereft of family, have joined crews, even becoming pirates. The
        Wooden Sickle is a famous ship of pirate youth that has been the scourge of the
        Ammeni coastline.
      %p
        Khaleans have a taste for drink, and import beer from Maldor and Goren and wine
        from Oran in large quantities. They are also known to grow marijuana, a plant
        which is smoked for mild hallucinatory and relaxing effects. This drug is said
        to bring out epic tales in heroes and increase sexual desire.

        After the Year of Shadow, a group of explorers found a forest like no other in
        northern Khale; metal grew up from the ground, gleaming like bright silver,
        sprouting branches like trees. This, the only metal in Khale, is said to be a
        piece of the Shadow Moon fell to earth. Whatever it is, it has taken root and
        grows in a parody of a natural forest.
      %p
        Moon-metal is easy to craft, and deadly sharp and strong. If heated over a
        fire, it responds to the user's wants to form itself into any metal object of
        superior quality. However, moon-metal severs the user's relationship with the
        Green World: merely touching moon-metal gains the character a circumstance
        penalty die for TREE-BOND (I), and routinely handling the stuff merits two. One
        cannot enter the Green World at all with any moon-metal upon their person.
      %p
        Moon-metal has a weakness for wood, it deforms like soft clay when clashing
        with it. A LUNAR FORGING (R) check can be used to force the metal to retain its
        form, however. Failure ruins the item.

      %p
        Near is not a very peaceful place, but nowhere does war burn as savage and
        bitter as it does in Khale today. The Ammeni Houses have almost all sent their
        mercenaries to Khale, many uniting their forces under one leadership in their
        hurry to subjugate the land.
      %p
        Reasons for the war are two-fold: The coastline of Khale controls the Hungry
        Mouth, making sailing between the Eastern Ocean and the Sea of Teeth a
        hazardous thing when even stopping for water can bring hostile barbarians out
        of the woods. The other reason is moonmetal, which Ammeni princes have
        witnessed and which they desire for themselves.
      %p
        Ammeni bamboo weapons are no match to what the Khalean warriors have, but their
        leadership has been tempered in the wars of Maldor, consisting of some of the
        most cunning and ambitious men to ever come out of that war-torn land. Ammeni
        troops group together, build fortifications, patrol the forest paths and guard
        the building of roads into the woods. They fight in closed formation, with
        harsh punishment to soldiers who endanger the unit by breaking discipline.
      %p
        Khaleans respond with guerrilla warfare, striking and then disappearing into
        the forest, refusing definitive engagement. The tribes that did have died to
        the man, with women taken as spoils after the men reveal the tribe’s location
        under torture. The tribes farther in the wilderness might have only heard
        stories of what is going on, but all Khaleans are family to a degree: they will
        all fight when the word reaches them.
      %p
        Khaleans do not have a regular army in this war; what they do have are HERO
        BANDS formed of the best warriors of many tribes. These were originally based
        on the lodge structure of moieties that tie tribes together, but today great
        heroes travel from tribe to tribe, initiating any able body into the war
        against the Ammeni. The hero bands are highly motivated and thoroughly skilled,
        and they are pretty much the only cultural structure the Khaleans have for
        bringing the war to the Ammeni; hero bands make long treks into areas under
        Ammeni control to strike at the enemy where they can.
      %p
        As the Ammeni supply lines grow longer and the war grinds to a halt, the
        princes are sure to bring in more weapons, whatever they need to pacify the
        land. Burning the forest and desecrating Khalean beliefs forces tribal forces
        into disunity or decisive confrontation. Three-Corner wizards, native Ammeni
        sorcerers and eclectics from Inselburg can name their price when the war
        reaches this point.
      %p
        Regardless, it’s the Ammeni mercenaries who gave this war its name, for many
        have died in the woods without warning. For most of the Khaleans it’s still not
        yet a single, unified war; when this changes and Khale rises as one, who knows
        what will happen.

            good for ambushes, attacking soft targets, avoiding decisive combat, false flag
            operations, misdirecting the enemy and so on. Honorable battles between tribes

            An item made of moon-metal is light, gleaming, stainless, flexible and sharp as
            it needs be. Whenever the item would normally be destroyed or broken, its
            quality merely decreases by one step. A moonmetal item does not have a limit to
            the number of imbuements it may have, and imbuing it gains a discount of one
            point. However, the item suffers when striking wood, breaking like a normal
            item subjected to the same Ability check; this can be resisted reflexively
            (that is, without effort or spending actions in extended conflict) by the

            The character can form an elite warband out of people who are united by

            SPEAK (R) to unite the warband into a HERO BAND. Such a band is created like
            equipment as per the SECRET OF CREATION, with the PURPOSE IMBUEMENT
            automatically included. Hero Bands can also imbue Keys. A hero band can be used
            by any member as equipment, although they can be disarmed by separating the
            character from his peers. The hero band is quite difficult to destroy, as named
            characters are more likely to escape and regroup than get killed; attacking
            their sense of purpose and loyalty is much easier mechanically. Cost: as per

            convinces the heroes to take the new mission. The character might also lose the
            support of the band if he insists on going against its purpose. On the other
            hand, band members can only be suborned by overcoming the band quality, and

      %p
        The basic function for Khale and Khaleans in the larger Near is that they are
        fantasy barbarians. In fact, they are my go-to barbarians in the setting: if
        the game is set in Maldor or wherever and I need barbarians, then the Khalean
        woods are in Maldor, or next to it, or there’s an off-shoot culture of Khaleans
        somewhere about there, never mind geography.
      %p
        Having a barbarian culture to deal with is a fine thing when you want to
        compare and contrast lifestyles. Khaleans are of course by-the-book fantasy
        barbarians, noble and harmonious, but that sort of thing can be played around
        if desired: the war makes jerks of everybody after they’ve hidden under a rock
        for a couple of months while waiting for the enemy to make an appearance.
      %p
        A specific challenge that certain sorts of groups might have to face is this:
        why play in Khale when you could be playing ORLANTHI in Glorantha? I don’t know
        how it came to be that way, but there sure are similarities. A cunning Story
        Guide might draw on the rich Gloranthan sources for inspiration here, I’d say.
        In fact, I recommend it: that whole heroquesting thing in the Green World has
        already been figured out three or four times in detail there, for example.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#id14{:name => "id14"} Ideas
      %p
        Khaleans are a very romantic culture, which translates to “good” in our fantasy
        literature sensibilities. Go along with that, it’s probably more worthwhile at
        first than undermining it: for instance, destroying or corrupting the poor,
        noble savages is going to be very, very tragic, regardless of which side player
        characters happen to be on.
      %p
        Alternatively, consider my Ammeni Wars campaign, in which the Worst War becomes
        regional as a hero band travels to Orania and wins the Senate of Kalderon to
        their side; even if victorious, the epic heroes are going to have a bitch of a
        time with the Ammeni reconstruction: what do you do with a nation like that?
      %p
        I have the impression that the Khalean capability for time travel has largely
        been neglected in practical play, possibly because it takes a campaign to such
        radical directions. Still, one day I’m going to play an assassin from the
        future, his only hope to kill the man who would sell his people to eternal
        slavery.
      %p
        Other basic directions to go here are the Celtic olden goldies, like shamed
        heroes cast out of their tribe, bards seeking their art in the oddest places,
        romantic troubles caused by the moietic taboos and so on.

        Khalean names are vaguely Celtic, of course. The moiety is more important than
        specific parentage for most purposes, so a typical name format in intertribal
        matters could be &lt;position&gt; &lt;first name&gt; of &lt;moiety&gt; in &lt;tribe&gt;. “Bard Nevins
        of Snake moiety in tribe Luthan”, for example. Alternatively, “Bard Nevins
        Snake-skin of tribe Luthan” has a nice ring as well.
      %p
        Additional bynames are added, but only for braggarts and people who actually
        make an appearance in bard songs, in which such are a matter of course.

      Qek is the northernmost known land in Near, and one of the most forbidding.
      Filled from coast to mountain with thick rain-forest and jungle, Qek is a place
      of mystery and legend. It is the borderlands of the world and the north coast
      of the Sea of Teeth.
    %p
      This hot jungle-land might well be left alone, were it not for the copious
      amounts of jewels found in its caves. There are no cities, no centers of
      civilization, only the smallest of villages along the coastline.
    %p
      The people of Qek live among the jungle in small family units. Short, thin, and
      brown, the Qek (as they call both themselves and their land) hunt wild birds,
      boars, and reptiles and gather wild fruits for their sustenance. The people of
      inner Qek are generally unknown to outsiders; the families along Qek's shores
      that live on fishing are the few that generally speak with non-Qek. The boats
      of these people are legendary - small one-man kayaks made of jungle wood that
      they use to surf on top of the waves of the Border Sea, easily outrunning any
      other ship.

        %a#the-family-is-a-breathing-thing{:name => "the-family-is-a-breathing-thing"} The Family is a Breathing Thing
      %p
        The only real unit of people in Qek is the family. Families live together,
        carving out a small bit of land to call their own, although there's no real
        land ownership. Three generations usually live together: a husband and wife,
        some of their parents, and their children. Generally, as sons and daughters
        grow to maturity, they leave and form new family units; as one half of a couple
        dies of old age, the other will live with one of their children.
      %p
        Qek has no government, but each family unit is part of a larger family unit.
        Within the larger family unit, families defer to the family they grew up in
        when they meet. In distant relations, the older family is deferred to, although
        they often choose another to make decisions. There is no clan-type structure in
        Qek: there are no clumps of unrelated people at all.

        The Qek do trade with the people of Khale and the nomadic tribes of Oran,
        exchanging wild fruits and cocoa for tools of metal, which they do not have the
        craft to make themselves. In addition, Qek is known for its precious gems. The
        people of Qek find these stones useless except for tools (they tip their own
        spears with diamond, which slip through armor as if it were butter, for
        example) and they are often traded for goods or services. Men from other
        countries that do not respect the sanctity of Qek often attempt to sneak into
        the country and smuggle out gems and cocoa pods, although few return.
      %p
        Apart from outsiders, the people of Qek have to contend with the APES as well.
        Apes are these furry goblins that live in various places in the jungle and the
        more hospitable slopes of the Wound of Heaven mountains. The problem with apes
        is that the Qek do not understand their language, if they have any, so there is
        much unnecessary strife with the “jungle people”, as the Qek ironically call
        the beasts. As a matter of fact, many of the apes do not have a language at
        all: the Qek goblins run the gamut from human-intelligent to completely
        animallike, but generally speaking they are all content to gorge themselves on
        fruit, intelligent or not.

      %p
        The Qek have no written language, at least not since the Year of Shadow.
        Because of this, their art revolves around painting and oral storytelling. A
        great majority of their art is utilitarian in nature: ornately carved spears
        and staffs; beautifully crafted clay jugs; shields painted with intricate
        camouflaging patterns. Without cities, traditional sculpture is almost unknown,
        although carved frescos in rock are relatively common, used to tell ancient
        stories.
      %p
        The music of Qek is unearthly, and most outsiders have a hard time appreciating
        it. Their language is made up of a multitude of hard consonants, which lends a
        guttural quality to it, whether spoken or sung. In addition, the music has no
        traditional rhythm, instead alternating between discordant rhythms frequently.
        While a large part of their music – all based around stories – is sung, it is
        sometimes accompanied by a CHURANG, a guitar like like instrument made of dried
        innards strung across a hollowed-out armadillo shell.
      %p
        Qek's jungles are full of succulent fruit and spices, and are used liberally to
        season their food. A speciality that has reached out to be eaten elsewhere in
        Near is wild boar glazed with mango and cocoa, a plant native only to Qek.
        Cocoa (in the modern day, chocolate) grows in huge pods within Qek's jungles,
        and is used to make a hallucinatory beverage called araka of dried cocoa pods,
        fermented bananas, and hot chilies.

        The people of Qek do not speak of religion: they worship no single entity nor
        have organized worship. They do, however, have a strong belief in the idea of
        spirits.
      %p
        Spirits have three forms, the ROHO, the SASHA, and the ZAMANI. The roho are the
        spirits of the living, the animus that gives them individuality and vitality.
        These are bound within the bodies of people, animals, and plants. People and
        animals have the strongest roho, while plants have the oldest roho.
      %p
        The sasha are the “living dead”. Those who have died that are personally
        remembered by those still alive are sasha. Memories from stories do not count:
        someone who met the person while alive must still live. These spirits have a
        will of their own and remember their name, and they are said to hover close to
        earth, watching those who knew them. Their will can be bent by changing the
        memories of their human tethers.
      %p
        The zamani are the true dead, those long dead and forgotten. They do not
        remember their name and their own will is the longing for final rest, in the

        The jungles of Qek are basically impenetrable and largely unknown even to their
        inhabitants. The native Qek may however increase his chances in the wilds by
        listening to his parents and to the spirit of the terrain itself. Geographical
        knowledge is not codified in maps in the featureless jungle; instead, the
        people memorize and share long path-songs that list distinctive landmarks and
        other important knowledge about the lay of the land.

        The earth spirits are considered similar but distinct to spirits of living

        simply a “place”.

        Knots make up the geography of Qek, which is otherwise indistinct and

        %a#id17{:name => "id17"} Actual Play
      %p
        The way I play it, Qek is all about the HEART OF DARKNESS. Even the natives are
        scared shitless by the jungle, which is quite foreboding, considering that Near
        does not know serious inhuman threats. Still, animals make believable
        antagonists, and the jungle can be difficult for other reasons, as we’ll see in
        the next chapter.
      %p
        The most difficult part of Qek play is getting a handle on minimalism, as far
        as the Story Guide is concerned. You need to accept that your story will tell
        about these seven or so people variously related to each other, and about the
        jungle, and about these crazy, lily-white (metaphorically speaking, although
        the highest class Ammeni are white) colonist/explorer/Ammenites who’ve set up a
        trading post on the coast.
      %p
        That trading post is important, because that’s how you get cultural interaction
        going. Qek has always been the most marginal of the lands of Near due to how a
        character from Qek is always the outsider. It’s even true to a degree in their
        land.

          Qek name things and places very simply, using descriptive language. It’s best
          if we do the same. They also have a tendency towards using the name of a person
          prominently for anything that person owns, lives in, uses or makes. So somebody
          might have “Chantica pottery”, or live in “Rimac place”.

      Some Qek need to leave their families and travel long distances for fare or
      necessity. Should they share their knowledge of the dangers and opportunities
      within the jungle, they become known as knotbinders, TSAFARI. Such travelers
      are highly respected even among strangers for their knowledge of the jungle and
      distant events.
    %p
      Game-wise I handle the jungles of Qek a bit differently from other places in
      Near: the jungle has no defined geography for my purposes, and I draw no
      traditional maps even for adventure-oriented play. Instead, the jungle
      geography consists of familiar places called KNOTS, connected by known paths
      into a web-like topology.
    .section

        %a#using-knots{:name => "using-knots"} Using Knots
      %p
        Knots are the ROHO of the land itself given form. A knot is a place in the
        jungle, wherein “place” comes into being by the perception and naming done by a
        person, the tsafari. Without tsafari there would be no knots, and the Qek would
        be as lost in their jungle as outsiders are when they try to penetrate it.
      %p
        Knots are connected to each other by PATHS, naturally enough; knowledge of
        these is essential as well. Paths limit different AREAS of the geography, which
        concept may also be used by knotwork Secrets.
      %p
        Knots themselves are simply Effects that describe the place they tie to: “Knot
        of Birdrock 3/R” might be a knot, as well as “Knot of the Death River 4/R”. A
        character can learn about a knot from another just by listening to their
        stories. The teacher’s STORYTELLING (R) check determines the Effect level for
        the pupil’s knot Effect – however, the pupil’s Effect can only get higher than
        the teacher’s if the two are on location at the knot. A character that already
        knows a knot may renew his knowledge by visiting the place and making a LOCAL
        (R) check.
      %p
        For knotting purposes we sometimes need to distinguish between “terrain” and
        ephemeral elements of a location. The Qek say that anything that has not left
        the knot since its creation is part of the terrain – even the people.
      %p
        Knots are created by tsafari – indeed, being able to knot a place is what makes
        a tsafari. A once knotted place cannot be reknotted without dissolving the
        existing knot, which of course destroys the Effect from any characters that’ve
        learned it. Knots dissolve naturally when the sasha of the knotting tsafari is
        forgotten.

          A character with a knot Effect can find their way to a nearby known knot with a
          simple LOCAL (R) check, even when lost. They can also use any paths between two
          known knots to travel without having to make an Ability check at all.
        %p
          Characters can also create new paths between known knots with LOCAL (R) checks.
          Keep track of known paths under the pertinent knots to remember how the knots
          connect together. Creating a new path is more difficult for knots that already
          have many paths and knots that seem like they should be far away from each
          other. A new path may not be created at all if the character’s known paths for
          the knot already number more than his knot rating for the knots in question.

          Tsafari can create knots outside Qek as well, but doing so requires gaining
          LOCAL (R) knowledge for the new area. For knotwork encompassing several areas,
          check all pertinent LOCAL (R) Abilities. It’s largely up to the tsafari how he
          parses the non-jungle roho; a single house might be a knot, or a single town
          might be one. This needs to be discovered in play.

        %a#getting-lost{:name => "getting-lost"} Getting Lost
      %p
        A pretty big part of this whole knot thing is what happens when characters get
        lost in the jungle. This happens when they fail their LOCAL (R) Ability checks;
        characters without pertinent knot knowledge get lost pretty much automatically
        when they leave the coast or other landmarks behind.
      %p
        Getting lost is like having a refresh scene in that it opens the door for the
        Story Guide to control where the game goes next. The character has only two
        choices: to WAIT or GO ON.
      %p
        A waiting character will encounter an interesting secondary character
        introduced by the Story Guide, probably by happenstance (dramatic coordination,
        that is): an animal, stranger, enemy, friend... a chance meeting that opens up
        new directions for the story.
      %p
        A character that continues wandering ends up at the most interesting knot
        currently available. Again, dramatic coordination – the jungle is featureless
        and nigh-endless, the Story Guide does not worry about where the character
        would “likely” end up.
      %p
        In a word: getting lost is losing control of story direction. It might also
        mean trouble: I typically have the lost character check WOODCRAFT (R) to see if
        the fatigue, disease or other fun things get to him while lost, causing some
        Harm and thus raising the tension for the next scene with people.

      %em Fluff from Clinton’s book. Crunch adapted from the same.
    %p
      Some Qek, through birth or training, find themselves walking the path of the
      WALOZI, or sorcerer. These people can speak to the dead, get rid of evil
      spirits, and even bind sasha and zamani to new bodies. The Qek are no strangers
      to magic, and do not fear it, but walozi cannot be part of any family once they
      contact their first spirit. They are ejected to live on their own.
    %p
      Walozi magic is worked through complex rituals that last anywhere from ten
      minutes to a full day and night. The rites gain much power from sympathetic
      magic, symbolism and other such considerations. The RITUALS themselves are
      normal Secrets, but they are only usable by awakened walozi.
    %p
      Conversing with roho and sasha is considered fine magic to use, and families
      will often consult walozi to contact their loved dead. Consorting with zamani,
      however, is dark magic, indeed, and any walozi known to do so is shunned. These
      necromancers will live deep within the jungle, performing their dark rites.

        %p.first
          A living person’s roho can be CONTACTED by the walozi, although this requires
          cooperation or restraining the target. The roho does not know anything the
          person wouldn’t know, but in cases of inner conflict, amnesia or other
          disturbance the roho might diverge from the person’s viewpoint. The player of
          the character plays the roho as well.
        %p
          Roho can also be SEVERED from the body to float in the air like a sasha. This
          leaves the body without will, barely alive. As long as the roho lives, the body
          will be sustained as well, but it will only act on the command of the sorcerer
          who severed the spirit. Obviously enough, this is considered a black art by the
          Qek.
        %p.last
          A severed roho may be CONTACTED, GIVEN FORM or BOUND back into his own body,
          just like a sasha.

          The living dead can be CONTACTED by the walozi. Much of the ritual concerns
          attracting the right person. The sasha decides freely what it wants to say.
        %p
          Sasha are normally invisible, but the walozi may GIVE IT FORM to allow it a
          spectral shape in the world. The sasha may still not directly interact with the
          material, but they may be seen and heard, which allows some Ability use. The
          appearance resembles the person when he was still alive.
        %p.last
          A sasha may be BOUND into its original body, returning it from the dead. The
          body needs to be either in good health or ritually prepared. A bound or

      %dt Zamani
      %dd
        %p.first
          Zamani are best considered as a sort of ambient negative life force. A walozi
          working with them is not dealing with individuals so much as just nameless
          spirit matter he attracts from the upper atmosphere to give it form. While the
          sorcerer might believe in a specific spirit, for our purposes we might be
          discussing pouring wine into a decanter just as well.
        %p
          In their GIVEN FORM Zamani appear as withered, gaunt ghosts. They are faceless
          and nearly mindless. A zamani might claim a specific ancestry in between its
          wails of pain, but should you believe it?
        %p
          Zamani may be BOUND to a dead body, either fresh or ritually prepared. Any body
          will do, even an animal one.
        %p
          Zamani are naturally bitter and need to be CONTROLLED by the walozi; they wish
          nothing but to slay the sorcerer and return to death. A controlled zamani is
          forced to obey the sorcerer, however.

        A sasha given form or bound to their body will be a shade of their former self,
        mechanically speaking: the Pools are halved and the Ability ranks are capped to
        the walozi’s contact ritual result, minus one. The number of Secrets and Keys
        combined is limited to the Ability check. However, an ULTIMATE (6) Ability
        check grants full restoration. A bound sasha acts like a living being, except
        that they will be automatically severed should they ever suffer MORTAL (6) Harm
        or worse.
      %p
        To make it explicit: player characters can be freely resurrected by these
        rules. I imagine that legends of the amazing skills of the walozi are known far
        to the south as well; all good fodder for epic storytelling.
      %p
        Zamani are much simpler to create: a normal zamani will have Advances equal to
        triple the success level of the Ability used to summon them, distributed in
        half by the player of the walozi and half by the Story Guide. Zamani cannot
        have Keys, and they may only have crunch allowed to animals (chapter 27). A
        zamani bound to a body is immediately severed when they suffer a MAJOR (4-5)
        Harm or worse.

            contact spirits with the correct rites and a PRAY (V) check. The rite probably
            takes about fifteen minutes, unless the spirit is already present. Cost: 1
            VIGOR
          %dt Ritual of Spectral Form
          %dd
            The walozi gives form to a sasha or zamani with a successful CRAFTWORK (I)
            check. The rite probably takes about half an hour, depending on how much effort
            the walozi wants to put into it. The spectral form becomes an Effect and lasts
            as long as the Effect is maintained. Cost: 1 VIGOR and 1 INSTINCT for the
            Effect. Requirement: SECRET OF WALOZI
          %dt Ritual of Binding
          %dd
            The walozi binds a spirit to a suitable body. This does not require an Ability
            check, but a resistant spirit may make a RESIST (R) check to make it more
            difficult. The rite probably takes about a half hour per paid Vigor point.
            Rejoining your own body is free and immediate. Cost: 1 VIGOR plus VIGOR equal
            to the resistance. Requirement: SECRET OF WALOZI
          %dt Ritual of Severance
          %dd
            The walozi severs a spirit from a body or spectral form with a successful BRAWL
            (V) check. This has no cost, but the walozi has a condition penalty unless he
            is himself severed, which can be done with this ritual as well. The severance
            may be resisted by this same ritual or the RITUAL OF BINDING. The ritual takes
            about a minute when corporate, while a spirit fight is instantaneous.
            Requirement: SECRET OF WALOZI
          %dt Ritual of Zamani Control
          %dd
            The walozi can control zamani with a successful CHARM (I) check, needing little
            but a special intonation and a hand signal. Zamani are otherwise consumed by
            their need for destruction, normal communication does not work. Requirement:
            SECRET OF WALOZI
          %dt Ritual of Vessel Preparation
          %dd
            The walozi can prepare a body to accept a spirit with a successful HOUSEWORK
            (I) check. The ritual takes all day, as organs are removed and the body packed
            with herbs, powders and wax. The resulting body is unnaturally durable: MAJOR
            Harm is considered MINOR for all purposes. The body is also now considered
            equipment, which can be further enhanced accordingly. Requirement: SECRET OF
            WALOZI
          %dt Secret of Eccentric Practice (Ability, Ability)
          %dd
            The Abilities used by walozi ritual craft are to some degree arbitrary. A
            walozi with this Secret has learned an eccentric form of the rites: the player
            may choose one ritual Ability and swap it with another Ability for all ritual
            purposes.

      %a#the-idea-of-ammeni{:name => "the-idea-of-ammeni"} The Idea of Ammeni
    %p
      The most evil man to ever walk in Near created a nation. His name has been lost
      to history, the Ammeni call him simply “Father”. As the legend has it, Father
      lived in the age before the Skyfire; he was a patrician of Maldor, a man of
      influence and discretion.
    %p
      When the Skyfire first appeared in the sky, people were concerned. When the
      fire grew larger, Father ordered action. His clients labored to raise walls.
      His factors brought foodstuffs from all over the Empire. His extended family
      gathered from all corners to stand by him. When Skyfire grew large as sun,
      Father closed himself off from the chaos outside, withdrawing to his estates.
    %p
      The land shook and clouds of ash blackened everything as the Darkness came.
      This mattered not within Father’s estates: the thick stone walls of the low
      buildings were like a secure womb that shielded the people within. Even as the
      weeks turned to months and months to years, as ice crept in long spikes down
      the eaves, Father’s foresight held strong.
    %p
      When the sun rose again, Father was distrustful at first. His sons insisted,
      however: Father was the first to greet the Moon’s gentle rays over the river
      Lamia, turned serpentine by the wracked torture of the land.
    %p
      The lands were deserted and in chaos, pitiful people covered from the Moon and
      the rainbow sunsets. Father had stores and men in his service, and tools of
      steel. His sons were quick to act, the first plantations were cut out of the
      wilderness to bring new prosperity to the broken world.
    %p
      Father himself quickly faded to background as his sons took over. The estate
      houses were reinforced and thralls accepted on the plantations – people outside
      the Houses through the Darkness were wretched, and happy to suborn themselves
      to the Ammeni.
    %p
      Soon the seven Houses were established as great plantations that fed the whole
      river valley. The influence of the Houses reached towards the sea, through the
      delta. Therein lived former subject people of the Empire, weak and destitute,
      unable to govern themselves now that world had broken.
    %p
      With time Ammeni came to rule the lowlands and the coasts, even encroaching to
      the barbaric west all the way to the mighty Absolon’s Way. The Houses grew rich
      and mighty, but they never forgot Father who sheltered them through the
      Darkness.
    %p
      The story does not end there, however. While the Houses outlaw all forms of
      religion, preferring to worship wealth alone, in truth every real Ammeni knows
      it: Father yet lives and guides the fate of Ammeni from the shadows.
    %p
      The concrete form of this belief is the Revenant Cult, a secret society of
      alchemists and House nobility who strive to uncover Father’s secret – eternal
      life. They believe that Father leads the cult and will reveal his secret to
      those who prove worthy of it by extended study and faithful service.
    %p
      The Revenant Cult is arranged into a strict tree of mentor–student
      relationships, with higher-ranking members being allowed to recruit more
      students than lower ranks. The cult prefers Ammeni nobility, is open only to
      humans, and hates elves and their supposed immortality fiercely.
    %p
      Glancing at the highest echelons of the Revenant Cult, we find Saul Lenoir, a
      man who claims to speak for the House Father himself. Some in fact think that
      they are one and the same. Saul is impossibly old and has found an immortality
      of sorts in an alchemical mixture of araka and poiture. He does not age, even
      if his body would like to decay. This is not allowed, and Saul consumes a few
      pounds of human flesh every day to keep his ageless mien. One of his ultimate
      goals is to shed even this limitation and truly embrace eternity.
    %p
      Even while the Council sets trade law and the Houses each rule as they please
      in their own domains, the Revenant Cult works its will among the Ammeni. Saul
      fears nothing so much as contenders to his plans, so he works relentlessly to
      keep others from uncovering his secret. Even with the aid of the Revenant Cult
      this is a ceaseless work in a land obsessed with the pleasures of life and
      death.
    %p
      Meanwhile, the Ammeni have grown into their role as rulers. They are known
      outside their country for their cruelty and decadence. Even if only the rich
      five percent share of these vices, the rest as well have grown heartless and
      opportunist in a country built on poison. The upper class has no excuses for
      their excesses, finest silks and bizarre delicacies of the fertile delta when
      the chattel slaves are worked to death or killed for sport.
    %p
      Ammeni is a country predicated on expansive colonialism and exploitation of the
      weak. Its national myths are cruel lies. The budding maritime empire reaches to
      embrace the whole of the Sea of Teeth. If any one place in Near is in need of
      heroism, it is found on the banks of the Poison River.

  %p
    This movement introduces the primitive southern Near, where the Empire’s grip
    never was very strong. The forces that reign here go by a different name. The
    theme is faith and destiny, as one eschatology is crushed and another church
    rises.
  %p
    The land of Goren has been split in twain by the Skyfire, and by a religious
    schism that divides the people into two camps. Meanwhile in Vulfland a crusade
    is flagging as a chosen people finds that the world is a much larger and more
    complex place than they ever believed possible.
  %p
    The south is a grim and forlorn place where human contact is not a given. The
    stories are small and personal, as everybody tries to fit in. If the world
    would be changed, it will have to happen on the side, almost unnoticed.

        Typical Ability SPECIALIZATIONS for Gorenites involve sheepherding, knowing

        Typical Ability RETRAINING for Gorenites involve esoteric religious practices

        Typical EQUIPMENT for Gorenites is metal, the finest weapons and armor in Near.
        Also staffs, religious symbols, Book of Light, troll fetishes, Goddess
        fetishes, dwarven tools.
    %p
      The lands of Near are akin to a tilted plane running from the Roof of the World
      to the Eastern Sea. The highlands west of Maldor have always been a source of
      metals and men for the Empire. It never was easy, for the hills are not
      deserted: the Gorenite clans have resisted the western lords for as long as
      they can remember.
    %p
      Today the hill folk are a taciturn and confident bunch; the Empire has finally
      receded like a wave from the beach, leaving the forts and guild-towns of Goren
      behind. A renewed sense of purpose runs through a populace gripped by faith,
      inspiring them to greatness.
    %p
      The people of Goren after the Darkness are split in two by a cultural
      revolution: the Gorenite highlands have gone through a bloody war with inhuman
      trolls, resulting in the Sky God religion gaining an unprecedented influence
      among the disordered Gorenites. Meanwhile the Jošland Gorenites in the lands
      beyond the sea remain united to their old ways of life and worship of the
      Goddess and her multiple husbands.

        %a#blooded-in-honor{:name => "blooded-in-honor"} Blooded in Honor
      %p
        The society of Goren is focused on clan holds, fortresses built on sparse
        hilltops before the Year of Darkness. A Gorenite CLAN consists of the people
        loyal to the clan chief holding the fort, often of people descended from the
        survivors of Darkness who sheltered in that particular fort. No land ownership
        is implied; land is only owned insofar as a family has an ancestral,
        established right to its use, a right that lapses when the family abandons the
        farming, grazing, fishing, mining or other occupation they have on the land.
        Because clan membership is often hereditary while people are transient, it is
        not uncommon to have members of different clans live as neighbors all mixed
        together in the more fertile (and troubled) areas.
      %p
        As the movement of people makes all the more successful clans increasingly
        fragmented, the nature of the clans starts to resemble that of farming
        cooperatives or outright gangs: the common form of justice in Goren is to ask
        for your clansmen to aid you in extracting whatever refurbishment is possible
        when somebody has wronged you. Stories tell of the time of the JARLS who united
        the land against the Empire in the past and ruled with justice, but those days
        are long gone.
      %p
        When somebody is a member of a clan, it is said that he is BLOODED to that
        clan. In Goren, you can only have justice if you are blooded, or have a blooded
        clansman speak for yourself: STRANGERS have no credibility to their demands,
        unless they come armed and ready to fight like the Maldorites did. In towns
        this makes for an increasingly large underclass of people forced to desperate
        poverty; the more urbanized clansmen realize the advantage they have, and are
        resistant to change. In towns three fourths of the population might be
        “strangers”; in the hill country, only one in five or ten.
      %p
        In olden times newcomers were eased into the clans through the institution of
        THRALLHOOD, a sort of contract slavery that could end in initiation; the
        children of thralls would in any case be free clansmen without exception.
        Thrallhood could come about as an alternative to killing an enemy in combat or
        because an unblooded Gorenite had no other choice but to submit himself as
        thrall to another. Today the Sky God Faith forbids keeping thralls, however,
        which means that admittance to clans is all but impossible for those with no
        desirable skills or considerable wealth.

        %a#divided-by-waves{:name => "divided-by-waves"} Divided by Waves
      %p
        In the pre-Skyfire era Gorenites were accomplished sailors and explorers who
        colonized much of the long coastline of the southern continent. It is unknown
        how long ago all this happened, but the Gorenite people on both coasts of the
        Southern Sea share modes of speech and dress, as well as means of living.
      %p
        The close connection between “Old Goren” and the colonies was severed by the
        Year of Shadow, and has been slow in being re-established. Some clans on both
        continents share mottos and insignia, but there are no chiefs wielding
        influence in both lands. The south continent Goren often refer to their land
        simply as “Goren” just like the northerners do, but the land has a separate
        name as well: the first colonists called it JOŠLAND.
      %p
        The environment and conditions of life are in many ways similar in Goren and
        Jošland: herding and farming are important to both, while Jošlanders are also
        accomplished fishermen. Trade is much more important for Old Goren, which
        produces much of the metals consumed by all of Near. Jošlanders trade as well,
        but they have a fierce reputation as pirates among the northern peoples. An
        Ammeni trader who didn’t stay to experience the savage skirmishes in Maldorian
        border marches would consider the Gorenites almost civilized in comparison.
      %p
        However, what really separates Jošland from Goren is how they experienced the
        Year of Shadow: while Jošland was sustained by its belief in the Goddess
        through the dark, and sustained its witchfolk in turn, Old Goren was decimated
        by trolls, underground-dwelling goblins that conquered the highlands during the
        darkness. The fate of Goren was changed when the cenobitic actions of the Sky
        God religion brought a new destiny to the people.
      %p
        The religious schism is not a large issue for common Gorenites on either side
        of the Ocean, especially as the two have been long separated, but as contact
        increases, the issue grows like a boil in between them. Witches from the old
        country have fled to Jošland, speaking of persecution; highlands saints of the
        Sky God faith have been attacked when they’ve traveled overseas.

      %p
        Old Goren is not a land of humans only: when the Year of Shadow receded and
        clans started out of their fortresses, the TROLLS were already there: goblins
        adapted to darkness, living in old mines from the times of the Empire,
        proliferated through the Shadow, laying claim to much of the lands people had
        felt their own.
      %p
        Goblins had always been rare in aboveground Goren, mostly stories of
        changelings and humaneating. The trolls were predatory and strong-willed,
        unwilling to relinquish their herds and heaths to humans hungry for land.
        Although solitary creatures, the trolls were strong; humans long secluded into
        their fortresses were weak.
      %p
        Stories of the troll age tell of great troll chiefs and their goblin courts.
        While clansmen are unwilling to discuss their ancient enemy in a neutral
        manner, many unblooded families of today descend from collaborators that worked
        with goblins through the early years and accepted their Trollish rulers.
        Understandably goblins have a pretty bad reputation in Goren, considering the
        long struggle the clans underwent to reclaim their lands. Often a lone troll
        would keep an entire valley in terror for a generation before moving out or
        being slain by COISTRELS, professional troll slayers.
      %p
        Today trolls are a receding phenomenon in the central parts of Goren. Skyclad
        trolls can still be encountered in the farther reaches, but most old trolls and
        the remains of their courts have withdrawn back below the earth, where they
        belong as far as coistrels are concerned.

            All Gorenite men are to some degree fighters, but the best are usually fighting
            carls in direct service to their chief, or members of a town guild that hires
            out to those who need protection. In either case the carls are expected to be
            ready for immediate bloodshed at a moment’s notice, and be quick to charge and
            retreat in serious combat, following their leader’s cue. Carls fight with
            swords and axes, or spears when defending a position.
          %dt Secret of Berserking
          %dd
            A berserk fighter fights without care for his own safety. Gorenite carls know

            treats all of his Harm as one class less serious insofar as penalties go.
            Berserking characters can use only SKIRMISHING (V), BRAWLING (V) and similar
            Abilities, and can’t spend Pools other than Vigor. Ending the state suddenly

            Most of Near’s metals come from Old Goren, either sold by clans or taken by
            force when Lords of Maldor come calling. Nowadays Gorenites despise mining work
            for religious reasons, preferring to leave it to the unblooded. Having goblins
            infest the mines does not help, either. The Ability itself is useful not only
            for mining, but also for understanding and utilizing mine architecture in
            moving in mines, or even siege warfare.
          %dt Smithing (V)
          %dd
            Gorenite smiths are the best in the world due to the mineral wealth of the
            land. The Ability can be used to work all metals, making and repairing various
            tools. Either this or MINING (V) can be used to smelt ores into usable form.

            When the character is working on equipment at least partially SMITHED (V), he
            can choose to create the work (and pay the Pool costs for it) in several
            phases; each phase has to end with an Ability check made into an Effect;
            failure ruins the work so far. Additionally, the character can imbue any number
            of Secrets into the equipment he creates, not limited by quality. Cost: 1 extra

            them. This Ability is useful in figuring out a goblin’s adaptations and
            addictions, its likely mindset and habits. It’s psychic profiling for creatures

          %dd
            Gorenite coistrels have studied goblin anatomy and may cause them grievous
            injuries. When the character causes Harm to a goblin, that Harm is AGGRAVATED,
            marked accordingly on the Harm track. Such Harm does not shake down and cannot
            be healed naturally. Additionally, the goblin suffers penalty dice equal to the
            highest aggravated level of Harm to any use of his ADAPTATION (V) Ability until
            healed. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Secret of the Skald
          %dd
            Gorenite music is heavily based on poetry; the instruments and singing tend to
            be simple. A character with this Secret can learn and create LAYS, long poetic
            Effects that can be preserved for later and duplicated by teaching the lay to
            another. A skald performing a lay can either take bonus dice equal to the
            Effect (not expending it), or swap his Ability check result with the Effect
            value, depending on whether he wants to rest on the virtues of the original
            text as he remembers it or strive to impress with his account and improvised
            additions. Cost: 1 INSTINCT to invoke, 1 REASON to swap.

          %dd
            The character has moved over the Southern Sea and has to deal with the similar,
            but not quite the same people of the new land. 1xp: Small things are different.
            2xp: Society is different, such as existence of guild-towns, or keeping
            thralls. 5xp: Fight over a religious disagreement. Buyoff: Return home.

          %dd
            The character believes in justice for his kin and the old values of fealty and
            honor. 1xp: Defend your kin. 2xp: Fight for your clan. 5xp: Choose to side with
            your clan instead of justice. Buyoff: Work against your clan.
          %dt Key of Thrall
          %dd
            The character has become a thrall to a Gorenite clan. He is obligated to work
            for minimal reward and cannot quit, but he has personal liberty, and his
            children will be free clansmen. 1xp: Serve the clan. 2xp: Get rewarded for your
            work. 5xp: Get abused by your master. Buyoff: Become free.

      %p
        Goren reflects my personal artistic vision a lot more than most of this book
        does. Specifically, the idea of Abrahamic religion and its relationship to the
        world at large and Nordic society in the specific, in both good and ill – I
        wanted to give it a proper treatment. It was a fortuitous coincidence that
        Josh’s vision of witchcraft fit well into my own plans.
      %p
        I’ve played through many, many sessions of thinly veiled critiques of religion
        in my time, complete with inhuman inquisitors and fanatic mobs; it’s possible
        that you’ll get that sort of thing with this material, too, and it’s not the
        end of the world if you do. The way I’ve come to see it, the attitude Finnish
        roleplaying takes towards religion reflects rather directly on the fact that
        our whole society is working to secularize itself and find some reasonable
        balance in regard to the ideas of Lutheranism. It’s just something we need to
        play through to arrive at something new.
      %p
        My immediate play with the Gorenite material has been more understanding and
        less black and white. The Story Guide is very much responsible for pushing
        against the preconceptions other players bring to the table: if a character
        concept is most comfortable with evil witches and faultless chaplains, play
        against that; if the player presumes that the witch hunts are brutal and
        unnecessary, perhaps there even aren’t any; whatever the characters think of
        the trolls, it just might happen that the specific individuals they encounter
        are completely contrary to those expectations, in good or bad.

        Sky God Religion brings to the table two completely different character
        concepts: the Highland Saints are impossibly good people with impossibly high
        expectations, while the deacons of the fledgling church are responsible for
        actual people and their lives.

        Witches of Goren can be wise or wicked, and their faith condones both as long
        as they come in harmonious forms. Witchcraft liberates women, but only by
        forcing them to express themselves through the feminine, not by freeing them as
        people.
      %p
        Urbanization of Goren is ultimately going to be the future. What does this mean
        to the clans? Is religion going to rule the society in their stead?

        hopes of the parents, and often still do in Jošland. A second name is
        patronymic, although in towns they’ve started to develop into actual surnames.

      %em Original material inspired by discussions with Sami Koponen, with crunch in homage to Richard Garriott.
    %p
      After the Shadow, the first generation of Gorenites was tied down in a long
      struggle against trolls to reclaim their homeland. In many ways the clans,
      weakened by the Shadow, failed the people then. Instrumental to victory were
      HIGHLAND SAINTS, warrior monks from the Tiserian monasteries at the Roof of the
      World.
    %p
      Now the Sky God Faith has been embraced by nearly all of Goren. It has brought
      justice to where there used to be none; it has brought a literate culture to a
      land that is quickly settling down; it has brought swords of the coistrels,
      troll-slayers, to make Goren possible again.
    %p
      The Sky God Faith is monotheistic, dogmatic, evangelical faith. It is but two
      generations old, and it is yet to be seen what, if anything, it has to offer to
      Near.

      %p
        The Tiserian monasteries are a chain of Spartan stone temples that reach ever
        higher up into the Roof of the World. They are ancient; the people of Near have
        always looked to be closer to the sky, and as far back as the monastic records
        go, people have been traveling here for a sense of holiness. The “highland
        saints”, as they are called, were already famous holy men during the imperial
        times. Their martial power was feared, as it was well known that they fought
        the frost giants of the mountains through the harshest of winters.
      %p
        The highland saints used to be reclusive before the Shadow, but afterwards
        things changed: as Gorenite lands below the mountains disintegrated into chaos
        during the troll age, monastic orders stepped up to support the clans. These
        assaults from the mountains are called CENOBITIC ACTIONS in the monastic
        language, to contrast with eremitic actions sometimes taken by individual
        hermits.
      %p
        The creed that Cenobitic Actions brought down to the lowlands is now called the
        Sky God Faith, a rapidly spreading religious renewal of the tired land.
        Highland saints and preachers are popular among the people because they have
        magic that works against the trolls, and they have justice; the Sky God Faith
        does not distinguish between clansmen and strangers, their laws are the same
        for everybody.  Thus members of Sky God congregations can expect to be treated
        with dignity, just like clansmen.
      %p
        The saints themselves are now tired and their ranks are thin after fighting a
        century to secure the Gorenite highlands from trolls and antagonistic
        witch-women. The reality of bringing wisdom to an ingrate population has been a
        disappointment to many, and they have returned back to their mountain abodes.
        Preachers of the faith step in to pick up the slack and maintain the zeal of
        laymen eager to seek virtue. It is unlikely that another Cenobitic Action will
        be launched anymore.
      %p
        Note the different implications of the Sky God Faith, Sky God Religion and Sky
        God Church. All three terms are used by Gorenites, often revealing different
        degrees of foresight concerning the direction the movement is taking.

        %a#the-book-of-light{:name => "the-book-of-light"} The Book of Light
      %p
        Ideologically the Sky God Faith is dogmatic and monotheistic: the God is
        invisible and one, living in the Sky. Virtue comes from listening to his word,
        revealed in nature. Vice is associated with lowlands, lavish waste and Trollish
        ways, such as mining. Virtue and Vice are recognized by their consequences, and
        a virtuous man should not be afraid to judge the boundary in between. Magic is
        a force empowered by virtue or vice, and not to be invoked lightly.
      %p
        In practice the highland saints are committed to bringing virtue to the
        Gorenites; they believe that a good life will be rewarded by the community here
        and now, if only the community remains true. The saints have started churches
        in all the largest towns of Goren and sent preachers to teach in the
        countryside, hoping to convince the clansmen of the wisdom of just thought and
        action.
      %p
        Interestingly enough, the Sky God Faith is a book religion: the highland saints
        have brought with them a great number of teaching texts that have been compiled
        with recent histories of the cenobitic actions – the result is called the Book
        of Light, and while its sources range from old imperial philosophy to Oranide
        poetry, it is slowly becoming established as the definition of the Sky God
        Faith. The stories of Lowden Mountain Man, the commander of the second
        cenobitic action, are an inspiration for preachers and laymen alike.

        %a#virtues-of-the-sky-god{:name => "virtues-of-the-sky-god"} Virtues of the Sky God
      %p
        The highland saints practice a virtue ethic that is best expressed in the
        dictum “God helps those who prove worthy of aid”. NATURAL virtues are those
        that come to humans without effort, as long as they are humble. CIVIC virtues
        are things like self-sacrifice and honor, which come with experience with the
        world and society. The saints have a complex philosophical system that charts
        out different virtues and their interrelations from first principles to the
        highest spiritual virtue.
      %p
        Virtues of the highland saints are represented as Abilities in the game. This
        is not because others could not be virtuous in these ways; rather, it is
        because only with Sky God adherents (and others who learn these Abilities) do
        we give the option of testing the character’s virtue directly, as a matter of
        conflict. You might wish to consider such a conflict more of an internal than
        an external matter: the issue is not whether the character can do something,
        but whether he will. The player choice to use one of these Abilities is a sign
        of willingness to leave the character’s intent up to the dice in this matter.
        The whole concept of virtue presumes that people can, to an extent, learn to
        act better by some measure.
      %p
        Virtue Abilities are all considered Passive Abilities when that is useful,
        usable in all the ways the standard Passive Abilities are. I should note that
        the Story Guide’s job regarding virtue Abilities is pretty much to say no to
        the player who’d want to use them to do everything. Rather, presume that a
        virtue can never be used for a non-passive purpose, except in a dramatic
        situation or through a Secret. Characters might get around this with the SECRET
        OF SYNERGY and other means, of course.
      %p
        As practical advice, I suggest taking the virtues as a challenge for gaming
        technique, as that’s sort of why I find them interesting myself. Consider the
        classical RPG PENDRAGON as an established example of what might be done here,
        perhaps, and keep an open mind. I haven’t had trouble applying the virtues
        myself, but I can imagine how they might confuse a player who is not prepared
        for the full implications of turning personality traits into Abilities. The
        Story Guide will do well to remind a player creating his paladin character that
        he will enforce the need for concrete, material Abilities, allowing the virtues
        to be pinged only in the truly dramatic or clearly internal struggles.

        %a#blessings-of-virtue{:name => "blessings-of-virtue"} Blessings of Virtue
      %p
        BLESSINGS are magical Secrets activated by the virtues; the Tiserian cenobites
        know of many miracles based on the holy writings, but individuals are limited
        to blessings they are granted – afterwards the saint who qualified for a
        blessing once may use it freely, nobody can take it away from him unless he
        relinquishes it to another. Blessings are handled like Secrets, except that
        they are only learned through Secrets such as the SECRET OF THE AXIOM, QUEST or
        HAGIOGRAPHY, or perhaps as bequeathal from a saint close to death.
      %p
        Blessings have different strength depending on the virtues they draw upon. This
        is reflected in their mechanical design. The following limitations are what I
        use: a Blessing with only natural virtues may not have a Pool cost above 1. A
        Blessing with a civic virtue may have a Pool cost of at most 2. A Blessing with
        the spiritual virtue would be limited to a Pool cost of 3. Humble Blessings, if
        there are any, would have no Pool costs at all.
      %p
        As always, remember that while we discuss Blessings being “granted by God” and
        such, this is just how the characters themselves perceive the matter. We the
        players know that God does not make judgments in Near – indeed, God has no
        mechanical impact in the game mechanics whatsoever.

            Compassion is the natural virtue of caring for your fellow man. It is mostly

            some social situations. COMPASSION is a Passive Ability.
          %dt Honesty (R)
          %dd
            Honesty is the natural virtue of truthful word and action. It is mostly useful

          %dt Justice (I,R)
          %dd
            Justice is the civic virtue of caring for the rights of others. It is mostly

          %dd
            The Book of Light calls the singular highest virtue by the name of SPIRITUAL,

            Ability just like other virtues, except that it is always associated with

          %dt Spirituality (V,I,R)

          %dt Secret of the Axiom

            A character with this Secret may gain Blessings. Either he asks for one with
            PRAY (V), or has an AXIOMATIC REVELATION with an appropriate virtue Ability.
            In the former case the player chooses the Blessing (designing it with the
            Story Guide if necessary), while in the latter the Story Guide chooses a
            Blessing that relies on the virtue in question. Either way, the Blessing
            costs an Advance. Cost: 7 minus the check result in Ability-appropriate Pool
            Requirement: Have no vices.
          %dt Blessing of Light
          %dd
            The character may make himself or a held token shine with unearthly light. Use
            an HONESTY (R) check for a revealing light or a VALOR (V) check for a blinding
            one. The check result may be used as penalty dice against creatures of the
            night. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Healing
          %dd
            The character can heal others of their ills with a preternatural force that
            makes things whole. Use a COMPASSION (I) check for physical injuries and
            HONESTY (R) for others. This may only be done immediately after noticing the
            injury; hesitation closes the window. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the
            Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Spirit Strike
          %dd
            The character can see and strike his opponent’s spirit in combat. This not
            only
            allows fighting with spirits, but also renders conventional armor useless
            against the character; does nothing against spiritless targets, though. Use a
            COMPASSION (I) check against misguided opponents and VALOR (V) against evil;
            the check result difference against the opponent’s RESIST (R) becomes
            persistent bonus dice in conflict against this one opponent. The result can be
            made into an Effect to extend its duration. Cost: 1 Pool associated with the
            Ability.
          %dt Blessing of Lowden the Judge
          %dd
            The character can unearth the truth by divine insight. Use an HONESTY (R)
            check
            when merely penetrating lies or misdirection and a JUSTICE (I,R) check to
            garner information currently unknown to witnesses. The outcome provides the
            character with pertinent facts equal to the check result regarding a moral
            dilemma. Cost: 1 or 2 Pool associated with the Ability, depending on the
            usage.
          %dt Saintly Blessing
          %dd
            The character can distribute his own Secrets (Blessings included) as Blessings
            to others, with the player redesigning them to accord with the theology
            (appropriate use of Virtues, Pool costs, etc.). Any Secret so distributed is
            lost to the character himself, unless the recipient pays an Advance for it. Use
            SACRIFICE (V,I) when touching the recipient and SPIRITUALITY (V,I,R) if doing
            this at the moment of Transcendence. In the latter case the character is
            literally taken to the Sky, and the player may take his time to distribute the
            character’s Blessings as he pleases to anybody in Near. Cost: 2 Pool associated
            with SACRIFICE (V,I) or 3 with SPIRITUALITY (V,I,R).
          %dt Secret of Monastic Life
          %dd
            The character’s Pool spend caps for all of his Virtue Abilities are raised by

          %dt Key of Courage

            Highland saints teach that without Courage any virtue will fail when it truly

      %em Adapted from forum discussions with Josh.
    %p
      Long before the Skyfire, long before the Empire, mankind existed in unspoilt
      communion with the world-that-is. The female principle of the Goddess was
      revered as the origin and closure of all things. This is the oldest religion.
    %p
      Witches are priestesses of the Goddess and keepers of the Triune Covenant. They
      gain great wisdom and power by immersing in the Aspects of the Goddess.

      %p
        Goren is the Old Country, the nest of witchcraft. In Goren stands WITCHMOUNT
        wherein covens gather in council. However, today the Gorenites have turned from
        their witch women to embrace the new Sky God Faith. It is even said that
        witches have been burned at stake, for the highlands saints consider some
        aspects of the Goddess suspect and all of them false worship.
      %p
        In Jošland, however, witchcraft remains as strong as ever: witch women advice
        and aid the people in their relations with each other and the two worlds.
        Witches live among the people and gather in covens for private worship. The
        bravest still travel to Witchmount like they did before the Year of Shadow;
        others look closer for meetings.
      %p
        Gorenite witchcraft is usually only taught in a concerned manner to
        WITCHBLOODED individuals, which almost always means children of witches.
        Witches can marry, but that often means reducing their commitment to coven
        activities, so many have children out of wedlock. An exception to the avoidance
        of marriage is the practice of TRIUNE MARRIAGE, a custom unique to Goren: clan
        chiefs and other important men of the community may, should they choose to do
        so, seek another wife from among witch women.  This is usually encouraged by
        Gorenite covens, and most witches indeed consider only chieftains worthy enough
        mates for themselves. There also exists a belief in strengthening the blood by
        marriages among the accomplished.
      %p
        Triune married witches do not settle down like normally married women in Goren
        do; they meet their husband as suits both parties, while the secular wife takes
        care of the chief’s household. The witch is expected to advice her husband, but
        any children he begets are her own to do with as she would. The children of the
        witchwife cannot inherit the chief and in theory there should be no animosity
        between the two wives, even while some sagas teach the opposite.
      %p
        Male children of witch women usually go into secular crafts, following their
        fathers; children from triune marriages are often adopted as bastards to the
        chief’s household. WARLOCKS, male witches, are despised, and while the witch
        blood may run true in male children, teaching the art to the boy is never
        encouraged.

          Men do not practice witchcraft, as intimated above. Warlocks are feared and

          the Goddess himself, and why else would he want to resolve his affairs
          indirectly, without honor?
        %p
          Instead, men of Goren ask the womenfolk for advice in spiritual matters. And
          when they truly fear for themselves in front of the supernatural, they call on
          HER HUSBANDS, male deities of legend. These entities are not actively
          worshiped, however and grant no magic today.

        %a#the-triune-goddess{:name => "the-triune-goddess"} The Triune Goddess
      %p
        As all witches know, the Goddess has three aspects: Maiden, Mother and Crone.
        All women embody the Aspects throughout their natural lives, moving through
        them in order.
      %p The first aspect is MAIDEN who is sinless and flawless, unblemished by the touch of morality. She inflames the passions of men – who seek purity – and she keeps the Harmonic Covenant with the natural world. She is rather than does, resists all and bends to none.
      %p
        The second aspect is MOTHER who is weathered and strong, rooted to the real
        world. She rules and makes decisions, runs a household, cooks and cures, crafts
        and raises children to her will. She meets with the other women and finds the
        Covenant of Accord in their midst.
      %p
        The third aspect is CRONE who is tough and wise, knowful of what is. She
        answers questions of things generally forgotten, guides the young and fights
        the fights others see not. She is a solitary figure, mindful of being and
        imposing the Covenant of Seeming upon the traditional beings.
      %p
        The knowledge of the Aspect Abilities is an everyday thing for women, there
        need not be any witchery in being a good daughter, mother or grandmother.
        Neither does a woman need direct life experience to know these Abilities; most
        will have some little understanding of each of them long before (and after) it
        is their time to live in the prescribed role.

        %a#tricks{:name => "tricks"} Tricks
      %p
        Witchery starts with simple things, wisdom that is only barely magical. We call
        these TRICKS. Each Trick set is a little Secret about how the world is made.
      %p
        As can be seen from the examples, Tricks really manifest as several little
        effects which can reflect different Aspects of the Goddess. These can be
        IMPROVISED: if the character encounters a situation where knowing the tricks to
        breath can be applied, the player can create a new trick for her bag. The
        limitations are really just that the trick has to draw on one of the Aspects
        the character knows, and it can’t be strong and central enough to be considered
        a Secret on its own; tricks are less important and powerful than feasible
        Secrets by definition. (Note that “smaller than Secret” is ultimately
        campaignspecific, just as judging individual Secrets for strength is.)
      %p
        An improvised trick can be written down by the player if he wants, just like
        the example tricks are, but he doesn’t have to. The difference is that if he
        does, the Story Guide has less grounds for complaint next time the same trick
        might be used. This is not to say that tricks are any more immutable than
        anything else in the crunch landscape; tricks can be turned into Arcana
        (explained later) and vice versa as the group’s sensibilities dictate.
      %p
        Everybody can learn the tricks, and it doesn’t take that long to do so. They’re
        not useful without understanding of the Aspects, that’s all.

          %a#creating-and-using-tricks-in-play{:name => "creating-and-using-tricks-in-play"} Creating and using Tricks in play
        %p
          When creating new Tricks for play, choose the theme of the Tricks and pick one
          or two facets it has. There’s little need to try to define more than you
          immediately need.
        %p
          A good idea for “weakening” a Trick in comparison to an equivalent Secret is to
          take into account the necessity of the Ability check, and perhaps give the
          Trick one point more of a Pool cost than you’d give it if it were a separate
          Secret. As a rule of thumb, utilizing a slightly exotic SECRET OF SPECIALTY via
          a trick is quite fine for my game; it’s a borderline-weak Secret for my typical
          crunch landscape anyway, adding an Ability check takes it into trick territory
          for sure.
        %p
          On the other hand, if a player gets a good idea for a Trick application, but
          it’s too powerful, the Story Guide may choose to offer it as an Arcana later
          on, or even on the spot for witchblooded characters.
        %p
          Traditional Gorenite witchcraft draws on anatomical themes for its Tricks, but
          perhaps other ways are possible as well. As Gorenite witches explain it, the
          world is the body of the Goddess, which makes it possible for the witch to
          manipulate like with like, the world with their own body.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#embodying-the-aspects{:name => "embodying-the-aspects"} Embodying the Aspects
      %p
        Women who want to be witches worship the Goddess. They live according to their
        chosen Aspect and gain Her blessings. Sometimes they do this instinctually and
        without knowledge of witchcraft, although this is rare.
      %p
        Usually a witch will only embody one of the Aspects, the one that accords with
        her current role in life. Some witches manage two Aspects simultaneously,
        especially when their lives are in flux. A witch is considered to be embodying
        an Aspect as long as she has the Key of the Aspect in question.
      %p
        A serious witch will sometimes find that she needs to draw on the magic of an
        Aspect she does not embody. An old woman needs the powers of seduction, or a
        young one has to strike down her foes. Such a witch may RAISE THE ASPECT she
        needs by other means; some sample rituals are provided as Secrets.

        %p
          Actual witchcraft comes in the form of ARCANA, Secrets that the Goddess
          provides to her adherents. Each Arcana comes with a limiting BAN and an
          associated Aspect; the witch can only use the arcane power if she embodies the
          Aspect and upholds the ban, although she can teach the Secret to others
          regardless of either. Arcana looks like this:
        %blockquote
          %dl.docutils
            %dt Arcana of Maiden: Flight
            %dd
              The character can fly freely with the winds, coming down wherever the Goddess
              wills. Alternatively, she can take a token of earth and air with her to control
              the flight and go where she would; the flight lasts until she touches the
              ground. Tying her hair will prevent the witch from flying in this manner until
              the next nightfall; if her hair is cut, it needs to regrow before she can fly
              again. Cost: 2 INSTINCT for flight, 1 more for control. Requirement: Embody
              Maiden.
        %p
          Arcanas might not spell it out, but the corresponding Aspect Ability is used if
          any conflicts arise over the use of the Arcana. Other Abilities may also play a
          role, depending on what the character is doing, exactly.
        %p
          The Ability to develop Arcana via the SECRET OF WITCH BLOOD is considered the
          mark of the true witch in Goren. However, they may also be learned through
          ritual magic (below) or from other witches, usually in coven environment.

              The character may embody the Goddess Aspect of Maiden temporarily with a
              successful MAIDEN-WAYS (I) check. The result of the check becomes an Effect
              representing the persistence of the Aspect. The witch needs to engage in sexual
              intercourse weekly to retain the Aspect. The Aspect will also dissolve if the

              Witch blood runs strong in the veins of the daughters of Goren. Usually only
              witchbloods are initiated into covens. The benefit of the blood is that the
              character can improvise Arcana: whenever the player develops an improvisation
              that is too strong for a Trick, the Story Guide can declare it an Arcana
              instead, and one which the character can immediately learn. Thus the character
              can improvise Arcana.

            %dd
              The character can learn Aspect Abilities and initiate into Gorenite witchcraft
              despite being male. Also, the character can use the appropriate Aspect
              Abilities to masquerade as a female well enough to fool other people.

              Gorenite women use many herbs and natural remedies in their everyday life,
              which reflects on their witchcraft as well. The Ability is useful for finding
              and preparing herbal cures, drugs and poisons of various sorts. The Gorenite
              lands are relatively bare, though, so the number of plants is not infinite;

              The character knows how to create POTIONS, Tricks that can be administered to

              HERBALISM (R), HOUSEWORK (R) or other appropriate craft check, which then
              becomes an Effect; the Effect can be given to another character or stored for
              later need. Once consumed, the Effect replicates the Trick in question at the

              The character can change her seeming into that of a natural beast. She gains
              the attributes of one, and gets to swap any number of her Abilities and Secrets
              for those appropriate to that kind of animal. The change is permanent until
              dispelled. The character can only change her shape (to either direction) when

      %p
        Finally, there is one other facet to witchcraft, RITUAL MAGIC. It is usually
        only practiced by covens due to how exhausting it is, and how useful it is to
        have all Aspects of the Goddess represented in the ritual.
      %p
        The ritual magic practiced by Gorenite witches is called COVENANT RITES due to
        the specific theological leverage the witches employ in contacting and treating
        with the Goddess; other traditions might have other ways to do ritual magic.
        The purpose is in any case singular, to communicate with the Goddess directly
        and consciously.
      %p
        When the Covenant Rites are invoked, the coven can bring to motion several
        magical workings all at one time, unhindered by the limitations of Arcana.
        Witches are not rules-wise limited in advance as to the effects their workings
        may have; instead, they are limited by the following principles:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          The magical working can only affect matters of which the coven has personal
          knowledge among them: people they know, places they’ve seen.
        %li
          The magical working can only act upon the Covenants embodied in the ritual: the
          natural world can only be influenced through the Harmonic Covenant, human
          society through the Covenant of Accord and the inner world through the Covenant
          of Seeming. Should an Aspect of the Goddess not be embodied by a ritual
          participant, the ritual will be completely ineffectual in that sphere.
        %li
          The magical working cannot affect people within the ritual space. Outside
          forces can affect them while they are inside, and they can communicate or leave
          the space, but their magic will not affect anybody within the ritual.
      %p
        Aside from these limitations, there is little the covenant rites cannot
        accomplish, provided the witches are willing to pay the price and try as often
        as it takes to succeed.

          %a#conducting-the-rites{:name => "conducting-the-rites"} Conducting the rites
        %p
          The Covenant Rites are prepared with a successful RITUAL MAGIC (R) check, which
          prepares the ritual ground. This check result may be spent as bonus dice on
          further checks in the ritual. Only witches with the SECRET OF THE COVENANT
          RITES can take active part in the following rites, but others can participate
          by donating support: one Pool point per check may be drawn from a willing
          supporting participant instead of the main ritualists.
        %p
          Preparing the rites can take a day or longer for an unsuitable place, while a
          previously sanctified place can be cleared much quicker. The rites themselves
          can last from an hour to a day or more, depending on the goals of the ritual.

        %p
          The coven chooses which Covenants to call upon when they begin the rite. For
          each invoked Aspect, the embodying witch makes an Aspect Ability check and pays
          7 points minus the check result from the associated Pool. Failed invocations
          may be repeated, but the cost is paid regardless, and failed attempts cause a
          penalty die to retries.

          %a#ritual-activities{:name => "ritual-activities"} Ritual Activities
        %p
          When the invocation has been successful, the witches may begin transforming the
          world. There are two purposes to ritual magic: drawing forth Arcana and
          creating ritual Workings. The witches have to cooperate on either, and can do
          either or both multiple times before closing their ritual down.
        %p
          Nobody can leave the ritual space while the ritual is in progress. Leaving or
          otherwise disturbing the ritual ends any on-going ritual activity without
          effect and sends any finished phases AMISS: the Story Guide decides whether to
          bring the effects of such workings to fruition, when and in what manner.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#workings{:name => "workings"} Workings
        %p
          When the witches want to make something happen in the world, they use WORKINGS.
          Each such working is worded as an Effect and created with one or more Aspect
          checks, depending on the covenants applied in the working.
        %p
          Each individual working is described carefully and visualized by the witches,
          often in many different ways to ensure that the working can find a way to
          actualize in the world. The Pool cost of a ritual working depends on the
          covenant:
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Harmonic Covenant
          %dd
            workings cost INSTINCT points according to the magnitude of the change to the
            natural world: 1 point for a minor change, 10 for a storm of the century, sort
            of like how Three-Corner magic is priced.
          %dt Covenant of Accord
          %dd workings cost one VIGOR point per person directly affected by the magic.
          %dt Covenant of Seeming
          %dd
            workings cost REASON equal to the RESIST (R) check or Effect strength of the
            target, if any. (Among several targets weaker ones support the stronger.)
        %p
          Keeping a working within only one Covenant requires careful visualization of
          the required magic, as the Story Guide takes care of pricing the magic, and he
          relies on his own vision of the working to do so. However, often the cheapest
          way of achieving one’s aims is to traverse through several covenants.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#drawing-forth-arcana{:name => "drawing-forth-arcana"} Drawing Forth Arcana
        %p
          This is much like a ritual working, except that the witches prepare one among
          them to receive a specific Arcana (which somebody needs to design). This is
          done by visualizing the effects of the Arcana, which is again priced by the
          Story Guide according to the Covenant formulas. This does not have to bear
          relation to the costs of using the Arcana in question, only to how the witches
          visualize it.
        %p
          If the drawing forth succeeds, the witch will gain the Arcana when the ritual
          is closed down, and may teach it freely to others as well.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#pool-payments{:name => "pool-payments"} Pool Payments
        %p
          All Pool payments may be shared between witches in any way to which they agree
          during ritual magic. A witch might well find herself out of Pool points midway
          through a ritual regardless. She has two options: sacrifice in compensation, or
          abandon the working.
        %p
          Sacrificing her own blood allows the witch to take on Harm equal in size to the
          amount of Pool she would pay in this way. Sacrificing the blood of others
          allows the witch to drain their Pools (any of them for any of hers) for her
          needs. Animals work as well as people for this purpose. This need not be fatal,
          but the bloodletting is difficult to control.
        %p
          Finally, lay participants in the ritual can offer one appropriate Pool point
          per head into each check made in the ritual. I wouldn’t accept nameless extras
          here (it could become ridiculous), but would rather create a Secret for public
          rituals and their benefits.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#ritual-effects{:name => "ritual-effects"} Ritual Effects
        %p
          Once a ritual Working has been paid for, it becomes an Effect (for no extra
          cost) for one witch who embodies the primary Aspect of the Working. These
          Effects persist after the ritual is finished, and bring about the magic the
          coven visualized.
        %p
          The effect might be immediate, but it might also take a day or two to come
          about, depending on what the witches wanted: an animal attack against a hostile
          chief might happen the very next night, while the estrangement between two
          people could happen over a season, for example. The Story Guide has control
          over the pacing of the ritual magic, except for one thing: the next time the
          witch learns of the target of her magic, the magic has either succeeded or
          failed. A witch should thus not be too hasty in finding out whether her magic
          worked, so as to not force it to effect at an inopportune moment.
        %p
          If the working targets a person directly or indirectly, the target can defeat
          the magic in ways that depend on the nature of the attack: a hostile animal
          attack could be beaten off by force of arms, for example. Conflicts against the
          magic are against the ritual Effect created by the witch. In whatever way the
          magic comes, the Effect value is what the victim has to match. Workings that
          nobody resists come about without fail, of course. Also, if the Working is
          forced to act in an awkward manner due to haste or foreknowledge by the target,
          the Story Guide may assign circumstance penalties to the Working: these are
          deducted directly from its value.
        %p
          A powerful working with drastic consequences will probably be taken to an
          extended conflict by a player character victim. This works the way extended
          conflicts with Effects usually do, as far as the mechanics are concerned; the
          wise witch might send several Effects against powerful opponents to compensate
          for their frailty, or she might use the SECRET OF THE WARRIOR RITE to tie her
          own well-being into the working.

              Gorenite witchcraft does not involve rituals in its everyday application, but
              they take precedence at covens and actual worship. This Ability can be used to
              support other magical Abilities when they’re applied in a ritual context:
              deliberate tools, environment and action help to focus the magic. The Ability
              is also useful in interpreting strange rituals, developing new ones and might
              support PRAY (V) in some situations as well.

              The character is skilled in blood rituals, and can make a RITUAL MAGIC (R)
              check to cause Harm to a ritual sacrifice and draw an equal number of Pool
              points from it, just like if she were shedding her own blood. The target has to
              beat the level of Harm with ENDURE (R) to stay conscious; if repeated to an
              unconscious victim, this is fatal, as is going over MORTAL (6) Harm.

              like it was herself who took the form of the magic. A Working like this is
              controlled by the player in how and when it comes about; however, it may
              manifest in at most as many scenes as its Effect value indicates before
              dissipating. The character herself is only vaguely aware of what the Working is
              doing on her behalf; Harm manifests as dizziness and illness that drains her of
              life. Requirement: SECRET OF THE COVENANT RITES

    %p
      The Vulfen are an inhuman race of lupine beastfolk. They mainly live in the
      eponymous southern wastes of Vulfland. Vulfen are heavy-built creatures that
      most closely resemble dire wolves the size of man, with long snouts and
      powerful hind legs. Their armlegs are more adapted to a running gait than
      manipulating things; the favored locomotion of the creature is a slow bound on
      four legs, capable of traversing long distances.
    %p
      Vulfen are intelligent yet savage, with an inborn inclination towards
      directness and predatory violence. They are also loyal and honorable, however,
      as well as sociable, just like the wolves they resemble.

      As the Shadow Night recedes, so does the place Vulfen have in Near. They are

        Vulfen are not known in Maldorian records from before the Year of Shadow, but
        according to their own legends, they’ve always been in the world, confined to
        the most distant south. When the Shadow Night rose and temperatures fell all
        over Near, Vulfen prospered in the lands suddenly inhospitable to humans. As
        the Southern Sea froze over, some even crossed over and staked territory in
        Near.
      %p
        As the Shadow Night has receded, most Vulfen remain in Vulfland, the extensive
        swath of tundra and borderline glacier in the interior of the southern
        continent. They do prosper in the maritime taiga as well, but the Jošland
        Gorenites have largely driven them inland over the last generation.  This does
        little to reduce their numbers: Vulfland is an enormous area, almost as large
        as Near itself, with plenty of room for the current Vulfen population.
      %p
        Vulfen packs subsist on a diet of hunted deer and smaller animals, as well as
        megafauna of the far interior. Nothing threatens them in their habitat, their
        ferocity and intelligence makes them the match of the largest mammoth.
      %p
        Despite their natural superiority, prosperity does not come easy to Vulfen
        packs: winters in Vulfland are harsh even with thick natural pelts, and bad
        hunting can lead to outright starvation. Vulfen are not accustomed to mercy in
        their cruel land.

      %h3
        %a#pack-society-politics{:name => "pack-society-politics"} Pack Society Politics
      %p
        Vulfen are competitively social: they put great stock to honor and face among
        the pack, to such a degree that they can’t quite enjoy life in isolation from a
        pack of worthy peers. Respect and expecting respect comes naturally to the
        Vulfen.
      %p
        The pack itself is organized akin to a wolf pack: there is an alpha Vulfen
        called VALRU and perhaps some beta VAL. A particularly powerful valru is termed
        a RUVALRU, the master of many packs. Originally all these terms refer to
        kinship: “valru” is a parent, “ruvalru” a grandparent and so on.
      %p
        A Vulfen will be uncertain without a clear hierarchy and will often challenge
        others for dominance simply to find out where he belongs. Even the
        scapegoat-like HAR on the lowest rung of the pack politic are happier when they
        know their position unequivocally.
      %p
        Vulfen have become socialized to humans in different ways: most Vulfland Vulfen
        make use of human dexterity when it serves their needs, going so far as to
        capture humans into servitude as FETCHES, hand-servants. Some rogue Vulfen may
        adopt a human tribe in lieu of their pack, often becoming kings or even gods to
        the human community, depending on their reaction to the lupine. Vulfen do not
        need human amenities, but they easily come to enjoy cooked food, shelter and
        other perks of civilization.
      %p
        Outside the cold and sparse Vulfland the balance between humans and the
        occasional Vulfen shift: a lone Vulfen finding himself deep within civilized
        territory often ends up hunted as a “werewolf” or captured. Such a Vulfen may
        be tamed and become civilized after a fashion, coming to appreciate the
        creature comforts that humans can offer. Being tamed is shameful for the
        Vulflanders, who might slay a weakling or pup unable to cope with the harsh
        life of Vulfland.
      %p
        The lure of civilization in its different forms is a perennial source of
        internal conflict among Vulfen: many Vulfland valru consider it an identity
        issue that Vulfen are akin to the wolf and despise any sign of civilization as
        weakness. Others disagree, preferring to interact with humans in different
        ways.
      %p
        A similar divided curiosity governs the way Vulfen relate to wolves, which are
        rare in Vulfland, outhunted by Vulfen themselves. Vulfen who would respect
        their primordial way of life often look up to true wolves, gladly adopting them
        into the pack; after all, the wolf is not conflicted by human concerns of
        morality. Others are shamed or angered by wolves, which to them seem like
        stunted, incomplete Vulfen.

        %a#dreams-of-agarim{:name => "dreams-of-agarim"} Dreams of Agarim
      %p
        Vulfen tend to scoff at religious notions – not because they do not believe in
        unseen forces (they have good noses, after all) or because they do not believe
        in spirits; it’s just that they consider themselves wolf spirits and heirs of
        Agarim the Father Wolf already, so they should have little to prove and less to
        ask from other spiritual forces. Again, some Vulfen disagree, especially when
        they’re forced to leave their comfortable pack life on the tundra; while a
        Vulfen would not be likely to stoop to worshipping other spirits, he might
        cooperate with them when their interests coincide.
      %p
        Lacking a religious mind-set does not mean that Vulfen are entirely without
        spiritual experiences. They take dreams very seriously, and hold certain
        respect for powerful dream shamans. While they do not practice dream shamanism
        themselves, Vulfen dreams are important due to their relationship with the
        common ancestor Ru-Agarim, Father Wolf. Most Vulfen believe that their dreams
        are visitations to another world, one in which Agarim reminds them of his way.
      %p
        Of particular import are PROPHETIC dreams, recognized as such when the same
        dream is shared by many Vulfen. Usually prophecies concern only one pack, but
        some of the most important, dealing with Agarim, are known to all packs in
        Vulfland.

            the rest: the player can invoke a prophetic dream with a successful BESTIALITY
            (V) check; the player gets to choose the topic of the dream, while the Story
            Guide chooses the rest of the dream. If the check is made into an Effect, other
            Vulfen reminded of it have to make a successful RESIST (R) check to not
            remember having the same dream. Otherwise this Secret functions as the SECRET
            OF PROPHECY.

          %dd
            The character is a majestic beast or cuddly pet insofar as humans are
            concerned. He can use his BESTIALITY (V) in lieu of CHARM (I) when interacting
            with humans. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
          %dt Secret of Pack Tactics
          %dd
            Vulfen are accustomed to hunting together. When the character does, he can

          %dt Secret of Duel Tactics
          %dd
            Vulfen resolve their disagreements with BESTIALITY (V) domination duels, both
            within and between packs. The character with this Secret can use other
            Abilities in those situations without fighting dishonorably. Cost: 1 VIGOR per
            scene
          %dt Secret of Fetch
          %dd
            The character has a fetch, a human slave. The relationship is seamless enough
            that the Vulfen can use his own Abilities through the fetch, thus avoiding
            penalties for using his hands. The fetch can also act at some distance from the
            Vulfen, though the players should keep in mind how difficult a lone human might
            find survival on the tundra.
          %dt Secret of Dire Vulfen
          %dd
            The character has grown into a larger, more primal beast. He now has to pay a
            point of REASON to use his hands at all, in addition to the penalty die.
            However, he may now activate any equipment mastery for his SECRET OF VULFEN
            with VIGOR instead of an overflow die. Cost: 1 VIGOR. Requirement: KEY OF
            AGARIM

          %dd
            The character may cause AGGRAVATED damage with his teeth, marked accordingly on
            the Harm track. Such Harm does not shake down and cannot be healed naturally.
            Additionally, the opponent has to make an immediate ENDURE (V) check after the
            battle against the highest level of aggravated Harm to avoid paying for and
            gaining the KEY OF CRIPPLE, unless he already has it. The player of the victim
            decides how the character is crippled by the bite. Cost: 1 VIGOR per bite.
          %dt Secret of the Howl
          %dd
            When howling with BESTIALITY (V) and using MUSIC (I) in support, you can
            communicate complex messages in your howl, ones that are heard far away on the
            tundra.
          %dt Secret of the Long Run
          %dd
            The character can make an ENDURANCE (V) check to run and not stop before
            reaching his destination. To interrupt the run before the destination is
            reached, other characters need to overcome the check result. Cost: 1 VIGOR per
            day of running.
          %dt Secret of Valru
          %dd
            The character is the leader of his pack. He can provide others in his pack with
            INSTINCT refreshments by leading them. Cost: 1 INSTINCT

            The character has become responsible for a hand-servant, a human who works for
            him. 1xp: Order the fetch about. 2xp: Take care of the fetch’s needs. 5xp: Your

        The Vulfen vision can be savage. I’ve wrestled hard with the issue of whether
        Vulfen are even playable: they are like furry Nazis in so many ways that one
        might assume that they’d only attract players who want to play a monster.
      %p
        As it happens, though, there is a trick to making this work: the Story Guide
        must not downplay the Vulfland environment. The harsh creatures and their
        unforgiving culture start to make sense when they are contrasted with the stark
        reality of the wastes. My impression was completely overturned when we found
        out in play that the Vulfen relationship to their fetches is not necessarily
        one of slavery – it could not be, when the land is so hostile that the Vulfen
        needs to support his fetch just to allow him to survive. What seems like
        exploitation may be cooperation necessitated by survival.
      %p
        This works the other way around, too: when the Vulfen go north, they certainly
        start looking unnecessarily savage if they insist on the values developed on
        the wastes. In my mind the grand narrative here concerns the grandiose Vulfen
        eschatology: how does the proud creature react to realizing that the world is
        much larger and much more complex than he ever realized? What happens when the
        other people in the story find out that ultimately, only those basic Vulfen
        values matter?

          As the name signifies, Vulfen are most common in and around Vulfland. It is

          Gorenites as the lands held by the Vulfen.

          Some Vulfen packs attack into Jošland during winter, stealing animals and
          causing trouble. This can happen all the way to the coasts, making the people
          vary. Low-level skirmishes between hunting parties and packs make the

      Far south of Near, beyond the Southern Sea, beyond the fjords of Jošland, lie
      the continental steppes of the southern continent. The maritime climate gives
      way to dry steppe that remains frozen three fourths of the year, and to
      southern tundra that thaws not at all. Finally, to the extreme south, there
      come the glaciers that grow and splinter in turn as the weather patterns slowly
      seek a new equilibrium.
    %p
      To the Jošlanders this whole frigid desert is known as Vulfland, the land of
      the Vulfen. The predatory beastkin rule a land unsuited to humanity: even in
      summer it’s too cold for a man unclothed, and there is little in the way of
      wood or stone to build from. The Vulfen do not mind, and they make sure that
      civilization does not creep any farther than it may.
    %p
      Still, Vulfland does harbor humans: caribou herders and fishers, and pickers of
      moss and berries that grow up through summer. The Vulfen consider hunting big
      game their own prerogative, and enforce this law harshly, but they do not care
      for the bounty of the sea that remains outside their reach.

        The southern continent is an extensive landmass that has always been
        inhospitable to habitation according to Maldorian records. The polar shift
        during the Year of Shadow did little to change this; the continent has moved
        farther north alongside the rest of Near, but the weakening of the sun has only
        extended the tundra to areas where once dense boreal forests held sway.
        Rainfall has increased considerably, however, and now great rivers flow south
        towards the great depression of the renewed southern glacier, slowly building
        up into a reservoir that will become a great arctic sea in time.
      %p
        Human people of Vulfland were there before the Vulfen came, or so they say;
        they call themselves the people, “Inuk”, despite what others say of them.
        Outsiders often ignore these natives in favor of the Vulfen packs in their
        tales, even while they trade with the humans for beautiful bone and thick furs
        of arctic beasts.
      %p
        Most of the Inuk live either in small lakeside fishing villages or stay on the
        move, following the half-wild caribou herds as they track the sun north and
        south over the year. Some few are hunters and fishers far in the glacier, out
        of the reach of Vulfen. There is ample trade between these population groups:
        the herders carry surplus production from village to village on their travels,
        while exchanging their bounty of bone and skins for pottery, fish, oils and
        other products of the sedentary villagers. Glacier-walkers trade with yeti and
        come annually or biannually to villages to gain the few supplies they can’t
        make on their own. Marriage customs reflect this interdependence: Vulflanders
        consider a marriage from a village into a herding family or vice versa a
        particularly conspicuous one, as the new family members make for trustworthy
        partners in barter.
      %p
        The humans of Vulfland are submissive towards the Vulfen packs that roam the
        wastes, moving over considerable distances in search of prey. Most packs
        disdain the weak humans, perceived as such because of their dependence on a
        multitude of tools, clothing and foodstuffs scraped from the ground. Through
        the Shadow Night the numbers of humans plummeted and Vulfen even ate human
        flesh, but since then the power relationship has been turning around.

        Vulfen are irreligious, but the Vulfland humans have an intense spiritual
        relationship with TOTEM animals, powerful dream spirits that watch over the
        people and regulate their relationship with the natural world; as one story has
        it, the Vulfen themselves are children of the Wolf totem, sent to punish people
        for over-exploitation of their environment.
      %p
        Totems are usually community-specific: herders bring their totem with them as
        they travel, while villages abandon theirs if they are forced to move to a new
        place. Sometimes different genders or occupational groups within the same
        settlement have separate totems. A mystically potent family or even a person
        might also have a totem of their own: in these cases people usually consider
        the person to have some blood of the totem animal in them, explaining the close
        relationship.
      %p
        Some people, called SHAMANS, specialize in communing with the totems and
        recognizing their signs. Most shamans are also expert dreamers; the next
        chapter discusses this facet of their power. The most important duty of a
        shaman in inuk society concerns negotiating with spirits that visit the
        community by possessing its members; some spirits have important tasks they
        need help with, while others just want to have fun and feel the experiences the
        body has to offer. The shaman sorts these out and makes sure the spirit gets
        what it wants, and blesses the community in return.
      %p
        Typical totems include bear, reindeer, seal, walrus, whale, various fish,
        arctic birds, fox, squirrel, wolverine and other common Vulfland animals. Wolf
        totems are not unheard of, but they usually denote a settlement under Vulfen
        control and are not actually active spirits. Communities honor their animal
        totems through special feasts, dances and ceremonies, vision quests, carved
        jewelry, fetishes, and totem-poles.

          Not all spirits are totemic; some are malicious and not of animal origin, with
          unnatural desires ravaging them at unexpected moments. Some are animal spirits
          driven insane by pain and grief. The general name for these malicious spirits
          is WENDIGO.
        %p
          The wendigo can possess a person in his sleep, but the more common cause for
          spirit possession is the breaking of a spirit taboo, the most prominent of
          which is cannibalism: eating human flesh is cause for spirit possession because
          the flesh entering the body also possesses part of the spirit, which is then
          allowed to enter as well. Animal flesh is safe due to totemic pacts made by the
          ancestors, allowing the animal to give its body willingly while the spirit
          escapes. Humans do not have a totem, and thus their flesh is poisonous with
          spirit.
        %p
          (In case it matters: Vulfen technically do have a totem spirit in Agarim the
          Wolf Father, but as Agarim does not negotiate with people, there is no pact;
          thus Vulfen is also a bad meat.)
        %p
          A being who succumbs to a wendigo finds that he cannot help but think of other
          beings close to him as his prey. They find themselves become withdrawn,
          solitary, but also desperate for the taste of the flesh of other sentient
          creatures. In most cases, an act which was taken for survival's sake becomes an
          allconsuming desire; some wendigo survive for a time by gorging themselves on
          animal prey, but sooner or later, out of desperation or compulsion, they turn
          to others of their own kind. This delights the evil dream which inhabits its
          victim, allowing it to interact with the physical world in the most gruesome of
          ways, savoring the taste of flesh and blood. Some mortals go mad from this
          possession, and take their own lives rather than face their twisted desires.
        %p
          Shamans are trained to battle these evil spirits, and can sometimes drive them
          away from a body. However, a once-wendigo has to be watched closely for the
          rest of his life, as he is now easy prey to evil spirits, without the normal
          protections that totemic pacts afford to the inuk.

            %dt Secret of Dream Exorcism
            %dd
              The character is experienced in dealing with hostile dream spirits, and can use
              PRAY (V) freely to support his dealings with them, and to exorcise their
              possession if need be. The target of possession regains any Advances they’ve
              been forced to spend on spiritual Secrets when the shaman frees him.
            %dt Secret of Spirit Boon (specify)
            %dd
              Spirit boons are blessings gained by pleasing spirits or mighty totems. They
              are exactly like witchcraft ARCANA, except they employ cultural Abilities and
              require the character to embody the totemic Aspect of the spirit animal the

            %dt Key of the Cannibal Urge
            %dd
              The character has eaten of the flesh of a person and thus opened himself to the
              wendigo. 1xp: Eat meat. 2xp: Treat others like food. 5xp: You are suspected or
              accused of being wendigo. Buyoff: Confess and get purified.

            %dd
              Characters with the KEY OF THE CANNIBAL URGE or who have otherwise broken a
              spirit taboo do not pay an Advance for this Secret. The wendigo gains the
              SECRET OF ADDICTION (HUMAN FLESH, VIGOR) for free. Furthermore, this Secret
              does not disappear if the character is exorcised; it causes him to suffer
              penalty dice equal to his currently expended VIGOR to any attempts to resist
              spirit possession when he is currently not being possessed.
            %dt Secret of Waste-Walker

              wasted. Requirement: SECRET OF THE WENDIGO
            %dt Secret of Predator
            %dd
              The character gains natural weapons akin to the SECRET OF VULFEN, except the

              and BESTIALITY (V). Requirement: SECRET OF THE WENDIGO
            %dt Key of the Totem (animal)
            %dd
              The character follows and emulates a totem, either because his community does
              or because the spirit chose him specifically. 1xp: Emulate the totem animal.
              3xp: Serve the totem’s goals, general or specific. Buyoff: Desecrate your
              totem’s fetish.
            %dt Key of the Shaman
            %dd
              The character is considered wise and able to protect the community from the
              supernatural. 1xp: Carve runes or fetishes. 2xp: Advice another. 5xp: Defeat or
              befriend a spirit threatening the community. Buyoff: Abandon the community.
            %dt Key of Marriage
            %dd
              The character would like to get married, which can be far from easy in
              Vulfland. 1xp: Interact with suitable candidates. 2xp: Prepare marriage gifts.
              5xp: Gain the agreement of a person involved, such as everybody’s parents,
              village elders and shamans, and possibly others. Buyoff: Succeed, or leave

      %p
        In my playtesting the Inuk have been a remarkably passive subject people to
        which things are done and who do nothing in turn. I wonder what’s up with that?
        Hopefully others will play stories that center on these people who live on the
        border of the universe.
      %p
        Specifically, consider the heroic potential of PERSONAL STORIES. I imagine that
        the Inuk heroes do crazy things for small reasons, like visiting other planets
        to get some wedding gifts for their sweetheart. They also do small things for
        small reasons, like stabbing each other to death for promiscuity. This zooming
        in to small things happens to outsiders as well: life in Vulfland is harsh, and
        sometimes just fighting for your own happiness is more than enough work.

        The wendigo might or might not come with a personalized spirit. If the spirit
        is not personal, then it’s up to the player to play the subliminal urges and
        monstrosity of the character as he wishes.
      %p
        The wendigo is powerful. If it could be controlled and corralled, perhaps it
        could even be a match for a pack of Vulfen: a weapon born of desperation.
      %p
        Meetings between communities are a low-key event for heroic drama, but
        important for the Inuk, for whom new faces mean new marriage and trade
        opportunities. Consider enjoying this material at the pace it sets.
      %p
        Spirit interactions can be interesting, as the smart community goes a long way
        in satisfying the spirit, whatever it wants. But there is a line at which the
        spirit becomes a liability; the good shaman knows where it lies.

        I am personally convinced that the southern glaciers do not hold just doors
        into dreaming, but to other worlds. Perhaps the two are one and the same.

      %em Adapted from forum discussions with Josh.
    %p
      In the deep south the world is less real than up north. Dream and reality mix
      up and entangle so that sometimes you don’t know whether you’re dreaming or
      awake. The Vulflanders have shamans who can walk through the dream and
      distinguish what is not real.
    %p
      Vulfen do not have shamans, but they do respect the power of dreams. Insofar as
      they have religion, it is based on the prophetic dream: when all the Vulfen
      dream together and in one dream, that dream is then known to be true for them
      all.

        %a#dreams-of-power{:name => "dreams-of-power"} Dreams of Power
      %p
        Reality on the southern glaciers is sometimes mutable, strange sights are seen.
        Green forests and weird beasts may be encountered, things of other words. This
        is because of the SOFT PLACES, areas that have yet not been perceived enough to
        separate the real from the imaginary. Dream shamans sometimes seek these soft
        places because of the power it gives to their dreaming; others dread them for
        the illusionary dangers they may contain.
      %p
        The southern aurora is connected to the power of dreams: it is said that dreams
        seen under the twisting polar lights contain great truths about the future.
        Such dreams, when they happen, are thought powerful divination that may come to
        anybody. Seeking the services of a dream shaman is considered most prudent in
        these cases so as to find out what the dream signifies.
      %p
        Aside from dreams of divination, there are dream visitations from totemic
        animals and other dream spirits. Vulfen do not have these dreams, as they do
        not have totemic animals. Humans take these dreams most seriously, however.
      %p
        The last type of powerful dream is the LUCID dream. These are especially
        important for dream shamans, as they can only make purposeful choices in these
        kinds of dreams. A dreamer will not normally realize that he is dreaming, but
        in a lucid dream he does. The dream shaman has usually trained to enter a lucid
        state during his dream; a layman will only enter a lucid dream accidentally or
        when provoked by a dream shaman.

      %p
        Other dreams are like recorded plays and can’t be influenced while they are
        running, but lucid dreams are different: they happen in an interactive
        environment, the dreaming of the individual dreamer. Because the lucid dreamer
        is aware and in control of himself, normal scenes may be framed within the
        dream.
      %p
        A character enters a lucid dream by making a DREAM-TELLING (R) Ability check
        while asleep. The check result gives the maximum number of scenes that the
        dream lasts before the character wakes up. A dream may also become lucid when a
        lucid dreamwalker first enters it or interacts directly with the dreamer; in
        this case a REACT (I) check may be used instead.
      %p
        A dreamwalker is a character that can move from his own dream to another’s
        using the SECRET OF DREAMWALKING. A lucid dreamwalker may interact with a
        non-lucid dreamer in the dreamer’s dream; however, non-lucid dreamers may only
        make Passive Ability checks, and they can’t realize that the things and events
        in the dream are not real.
      %p
        Once a lucid dreamer is present, he may opt to shape a dream freely, or act
        within the dream, possibly making Ability checks. A DREAM-TELLING (R) check may
        be required to make complex changes or make emotionally powerful changes
        without waking the dreamer up. Social interaction is possible in a dream almost
        normally, but any action that would cause Harm, refresh Pools or otherwise
        affect the dreamer mechanically will wake the dreamer instead. Secrets can and
        will change this; Vulflanders fear nothing as much as a dream shaman turned
        into an enemy, as a non-lucid layman is all but helpless against a phantasmal
        killer within his own dream; horrible nightmares are the least danger, many
        enemies of dream shamans are found under their own furs in the morning, frozen
        to death as if they’d spent the night naked on the glacier.
      %p
        A lucid dreamer may awake accidentally just like a non-lucid dreamer would, but
        only within his own dream. Within another’s dream he will only wake with a
        DREAM-TELLING (R) check, when his dreamtime runs out or when the other dreamer
        wakes, which wakes up everybody visiting that dream.
      %p
        Aside from the above, dream scenes may be played the same as any scene.
        However, circumstantial penalty dice work differently within a dream: the Story
        Guide may assign up to five penalty or bonus dice to individual checks; he is
        encouraged to make these decisions according to seemingly arbitrary criteria
        that hide a poetic logic. Different things are feasible in a dream than would
        be in reality.

            (probably himself on the night’s first walk) has to know the target character,

            successful Ability check. Dream Harm is similar to normal, except that only the
            highest inflicted level counts; it becomes real Harm come morn. This Secret may
            affect a lucid dreamer as well, but only if he opts to not wake up. A non-lucid

            participants can opt out akin to the SECRET OF NIGHTMARE. Non-lucid dreamers

            even death – all become real for everybody in the true dream space. All
            interactions are possible just like they would be in reality. Characters may
            enter and leave the true dream by dreamwalking or getting out of the defined
            space otherwise. Waking up within the true dream is impossible; only waning of

            dreams of the target and making an Effect out of the Ability check; if the
            target later encounters the situation described in the Effect, he has to
            immediately win the Effect with a RESIST (R) check to avoid acting according to
            his conditioning. Cost: As normal for Effects. Requirement: SECRET OF NIGHTMARE

          %dd
            Normally characters acting within dreams need specific, appropriate Abilities
            to their conditions. Thus a character flying in a dream might need a FLYING
            Ability of some sort, for example. With this Secret the character can replace
            any Abilities needed within a dream with artistic Abilities, such as STORY-TELL
            (R) or CRAFTWORK (I). This even works for DREAM-TELLING (R) when used to shape
            dreams directly (but not for dreamwalking or other non-shaping activities).

        The Pool costs of the various dream shaman Secrets are given in generic Pool
        points, but the actual Pool used is not arbitrary: the current MODE of the
        dream determines which Pool the shaman needs to use to activate his magic.
      %p
        Each dream scene always starts with a mode that accords with the largest
        current Pool of the dreaming character. A dreamer may switch the mode by making
        an Ability check: the mode always accords with the last Ability checked in the
        dream scene, but only if it is stronger than the last mode-change.
        DREAM-TELLING (R) does not count; in fact, the associated Pool of the
        DREAM-TELLING Ability itself switches with the mode when the character is
        dreaming.
      %p
        Non-dreaming Secrets, when used within dream, are affected by the mode as well:
        when a character pays points from any Pool, all but one of those points come
        out of the current mode Pool instead. A payment of three VIGOR during a REASON
        mode would turn into 2 REASON and 1 VIGOR, for example.

        Running out of the mode Pool wakes the dreamer up immediately, provided that

        Spirits are powerful dreams that do not dissolve when the morning comes.
        Instead, they escape to the soft places to wait out the day. Some, such as
        totem spirits, are ancient, powerful and wise, rarely coming out of the soft
        places. Others are fearsome and hungry, such as the wendigo.
      %p
        Spirits are just like lucid dreamers (in fact, lucid dreamers are like spirits,
        except that they have a body to return to) when it comes to moving through
        dreams, interacting with dreamers and so on and so forth. It is far from
        unknown for a dream shaman to forge relationships with spirits.
      %p
        A dream spirit newly summoned has Advances equal to triple the success level of
        the Ability check used to summon it, distributed in half by the player of the
        dream shaman and half by the Story Guide. Dream spirits may be very imaginative
        in their composition, built out of dream logic. Free spirits of course may have
        whatever statistics the Story Guide finds best. Dream spirits encountered in
        the real world have their strength reduced: halve their Pools and reduce
        Ability levels by one. Dream spirits encountered during the day are also
        fragile: anybody who has a reason to suspect may make a REACT (I) check to
        recognize the creature for a dream and dissolve it. For this reason dream
        spirits almost never make an appearance outside the soft places and dreams.
        Dream items brought out into the world follow similar rules: their quality
        drops by one, and a successful disbelief causes the item to disappear. For this
        reason a dream shaman might make his dream equipment seem mundane, so as to

        preventing a real being from moving into the dream or a dream spirit or item
        from becoming real in a soft place, provided they know how to dreamwalk and
        know of the soft place. A person going bodily into the dream cannot awaken
        accidentally or by force; they are like a dream spirit. A person who comes out
        of a soft place into the world during a dream endangers his original body most
        gravely; he also loses one level from all of his Abilities and half of his
        Pools until he returns to the dreaming and/or his own body.
      %p
        Most soft places are actually in the process of hardening, so they are not so
        pure anymore: in these places circumstance penalties may be suffered,
        manifesting spirits may be even weaker, going into the dream bodily may not
        work at all and the power of dream is otherwise limited. Dream shamans both
        fear and covet pure dreaming places for their great power.

        The dream landscape is different for the different peoples of Near. Individual
        dreams are greatly influenced by personal experiences and cultural background,
        which often allows a dream shaman perceiving the dream to learn much about the
        person himself. However, this is nothing compared to the differences between
        the dreams of the races: a dream shaman may take a great risk by going into the
        dreams of people they do not understand.

          dreams are the default described earlier; they are colorful and varied in
          properties, reflecting the person of the dreamer. The large circumstance
          penalty range makes the dreams whimsical and chaotic if one does not solve the
          dream logic the Story Guide uses in assigning the dice.

        %dd
          do not dream, for they consider the world itself the dream. This does not
          mean that they are completely unaffected by the dream world; auroras interfere
          with Elven auras and soft places sometimes seem more real to them than reality
          does.

          dreams are largely inherited; they dream of things their ancestors did
          and felt, not of imaginary things. The goblin himself is usually encountered in
          the shape of one of his ancestors in the dream. Goblins might well learn
          important things from these dreams, if they realize their significance.
        %dt Dwarven
        %dd
          dreams are utopian: they almost always concern the ultimate success of the
          individual dwarf’s purpose. There are no circumstance penalties in dwarven
          dreams, and in fact using any bonus or penalty dice carries an additional
          surcharge of one associated Pool point.

        %dd
          dreams are slow and calm, with no loud sounds. Giants themselves are humans in
          their dreams, and part of society. Visiting dreamwalkers are usually
          insubstantial on-lookers, unless they manage to materialize somehow.

        %dd
          such as ratkin or Vulfen, all have similar dreams. Beastkin in dream take the
          shape of a pure animal, albeit they may still speak if they want to. Humanite
          dreamwalkers in beastkin dreams lose their own nature, instead becoming like a
          beastkin most reflecting their inner spirit (SG choice); this may be an
          existing kin, or one that is only real in dreams. Otherwise beastkin dreams are
          relatively mundane, following rules from reality.

          and other ”neutral” dream territory might be considered in this context as
          well. They are, perhaps surprisingly, very life-like, and have no special rules
          to them. Of course, unearthly things may still be encountered just the same.
          Sometimes a soft place takes on the qualities of the dreams of their residents,
          though, if people live in them.

      Vulfen do not know religion. The closest they come is a belief in prophetic
      dreams, which is hardly baseless on the boreal plains. However, Vulfen do have
      an eschatology, a racial destiny if you will. All packs tell this story, and
      they often dream of it as well. The humans of Vulfland tell the story, too;
      indeed, theirs is often the more evocative and detailed telling.
    %p
      Father Wolf Agarim was the first being who killed and ate of his kill. This
      happened when the world was new, cold and dark. Agarim then was just an animal,
      content to merely exist in all the ways that wolves do.
    %p
      Things from the deep waters attacked and forced animals to leave Agarim’s
      territory. They were large and of many forms. Agarim fought back and hunted his
      rivals to the soft places of the world.
    %p
      Later Agarim beget all beasts, which started the first Wolf Age. All other
      animals multiplied greatly and became food to the carnivores.
    %p
      The first Wolf Age was timeless, and therefore had to end. This was signified
      when the sun rose, bringing with it warmth and people. Where the sun reached,
      it brought people with their houses and tame animals. Wolves retreated to
      places that people did not want.
    %p
      When animals came to contact with people, their ways changed and they came to
      depend on the humans for succor. Men sent heroes into the soft places to tame
      them; their presence caused the soft places to fold up and give way.
    %p
      When the great empire rose in Near, natural ways were cast aside. Even many men
      knew then that the natural order had been shaken; they looked for refuge on the
      southern continent, far from the grasp of the emperor.
    %p
      Everything comes to an end, but for few things it comes in as spectacular
      manner as it did for the Empire of Maldor. Agarim, who had slept through the
      Sun Age, opened his Eye: it was like a burning disk in the sky, slowly opening
      into something greater than the Sun itself.
    %p
      Agarim swallowed the Sun and cast the world back into the darkness, intent on a
      new Wolf Age ruled by his children. This act was significant, for it revealed a
      change in Agarim as well: like the other animals, he was also changed by men,
      becoming something more like them and less like himself. Agarim of old would
      merely exist, content in the ways of the wolf.
    %p
      Vulfen are the children of Agarim in the second Wolf Age. As the Shadow came
      over Near, they multiplied and encroached upon lands settled by people. They
      even crossed the frozen sea to the northern continent.
    %p
      No creature could resist Vulfen during the shadow night. Humans cast down their
      totems and took to worshipping Agarim, the oldest of them all. Vulfen did not
      think to own the land like humans thought, but they did not think to allow the
      humans to own it, either; human villages were mercilessly culled by the Vulfen,
      ensuring that none would grow powerful enough to pose a danger to Agarim’s ilk.
    %p
      Something went wrong, however, and the sun returned. Agarim’s Eye returned as
      well, but now it was pale and sickly. Gorenites came back out of their holes
      with the sun and started building and farming again. They even captured Vulfen
      and tamed them.
    %p
      Taming was something of a revelation to Vulfen, who feared the condition
      greatly, thinking that it made them slow and stupid. In time they learned to be
      suspicious of humans and only interact with them through fetches, people taken
      from their villages to serve a Vulfen pack.
    %p
      In time the land Vulfen would not allow people to own came to be known as
      “Vulfland” to the humans up north. The land humans could hold against the
      Vulfen was known as “Jošland”, for its apocryphal founder.
    %p
      Vulfen do not have religion, but they do have dreams: when all packs dream
      together, that dream is known to be true to all. Agarim swallowing the sun and
      Vulfen ruling the earth – this dream was known to all Vulfen of the last
      generation, and the generation before that.
    %p
      Today Vulfen are uncertain: is this the second Wolf Age? Some claim to know the
      dream of Agarim, but as many as have dreams have abandoned their packs to live
      with humans, dreaming of nothing. The sun is weaker than ever, but nobody knows
      if it is weak enough.

      have always been with humanity in one way or another.

        Humans are the default species of the game, they don’t have any special rules
        attached to them aside from some optional crunch on the facing page. Other
        species, however, do: each has a mandatory Secret they need to take to belong
        to that species. (It costs an Advance, too.) In addition, each species has
        various other specific crunch the player may sample at their pleasure.
      %p
        The Old Species have a special place, as they are all long ubiquitous in all
        parts of Near. Thus all civilizations have had to form some sort of stance on
        them. Even the rare elves and giants are known as something other than pure
        fantasy to all but the most ignorant.
      %p
        The Beastkin, meanwhile, tend to be local to certain parts of Near. Partially
        this is because they’ve been in the world for such a short time, partially
        because their instincts are adapted best to their home terrain.

          As with everything else, the species are very much optional content that should

          in every land of Near, but it’s up to you to decide what.

          In this case I’m not even close to joking. This material can have a huge impact
          on the nature of the game; if you haven’t already, throw out that need to have
          an unitary canon reality where all setting material is under consideration all
          the time. For instance, consider this: the original TSoY book by Clinton
          featured a tri-partite, “classical” Human Equation where all creatures of Near
          were interpreted as either elves, humans or goblins. This is a beautiful and
          uncomplicated model, and I do not for a moment consider refuting it by merely
          including other species. Rather, consider the expanded Human Equation as an
          alternative model that intentionally breaks the metaphysics: the group has to
          actively work to figure out how these beings, and these only, fit into the
          Equation.

        It is practical to make humans the baseline of “people” in Near, as that’s what
        we are. Humans of Near come in all colors, shapes and sizes we know from Earth.
        Most distinct ethnicities seem like one or other people from the coasts of the
        Indian Ocean, but everybody seems to be in there somewhere, such as the
        Caucasian nobility of Maldor, for example.
      %p
        What makes humans distinct from other peoples of Near is their passion –
        humanity, simply put. Humans commit to values, beliefs and ideologies, make
        them part of their own identity. They find differences and similarities with
        each other and stranger beings. No other being is as responsive to religion or
        as prone to fear as humans are. Each and every one of them thinks on some level
        that he is special.
      %p
        I wouldn’t worry too much about the fact that non-humans are to a degree
        archetypal and one-dimensional as individuals when compared to the immense
        individuality of humanity. That is what they are there for: if you didn’t want
        your character to have the weight of a whole racial destiny as part of his
        identity politics, then a non-human was a weird character choice to begin with.
      %p
        The one thing humans have that distinguishes them from others is the ultimate
        passion, Love. In fact, it is such an important part of their being that the
        Human Equation runs mostly on it. Other Old Species do not know Love – whether
        anybody but humans does is an open question.

      %em Fluff from Clinton’s book. Crunch adapted from the book and forum discussions.
    %p
      Elves are human-like creatures, yet more perfect and independent in every way.
      They do not spawn children nor do they grow old or die of violence or illness;
      they are self-sufficient and aloof creatures that are despised, feared or
      revered.
    %p
      For the most part elves seem human, except that their bodies are too perfect to
      be real; an elf creates its own body by the force of their will. They all have
      a fair seeming, with skin color ranging from light olive to pale alabaster,
      hair white, golden or reddish sand. An inner light enlightens them so: all
      elves are unmistakable in that they have an AURA, a soft nimbus of light that
      surrounds them. It might be missed at mid-day, but at night an elf is obvious
      to the eye.
    %p
      Elves tend to be solitary creatures without roots. This is not to say that they
      are not social; they can be incredibly magnetic. They do not, however, usually
      settle down in one place and form lasting relationships. It is said that one
      cannot trust an elf for “whatever good he does, he does for his own purposes”.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#immortality{:name => "immortality"} Immortality
      %p
        Elves are people who have looked deep within and found only one thing there:
        the self. Dedicated like a Zen master, they have realized the world is illusory
        and the only truth is what one thinks of one's self. Upon the death of the
        body, these souls do not pass on, but return again and again, as a more perfect
        form.
      %p
        This sort of worldview kind of shuts the door on most religion. The elf
        recognizes no god or greater power, only more powerful souls. Strangely, this
        sort of self-absorption doesn't always lead to evil: many elves roam the world
        doing good to either appease something inside them or perhaps for amusement.
        Others strike down anything in their path, realizing the insignificance of
        others that have not achieved their enlightenment. Whatever the attitude, an
        elf lives on, seeking to know itself deeper.
      %p
        Sometimes, an elf strays from this path. They were once human, after all,
        although it's not too wise to mention that. Any time an elf recognizes another
        life as greater than his own, he falls from Elfhood. If an elf either saves the
        life of another, dying or becoming mortally wounded in the process, or has
        children, they become somewhat human.  (If the elf died for another, he is
        reborn a last time.) Their aura dims and becomes grey, and they begin to get
        older like a human: they have entered the Grey Age. Other elves usually despise
        a Grey One for his weakness.
      %p
        Mechanically, an elf turns grey by buying off the KEY OF THE SELF. A grey elf
        loses his aura and all crunch related to it (losing the Advances, note), but
        retains his memory of the past. He can also gain human crunch afterwards.

        %a#elven-magic{:name => "elven-magic"} Elven Magic
      %p
        The most powerful magic of the elf is the fact that it's immortal. Elves come
        into this world at maturity, and do not age unless they want to. Most do, over
        their many incarnations, as their self-image becomes more wizened. They do not
        catch diseases, although they can be poisoned. Their body is only a shell they
        have created, and even if struck down, they return to the world of Near.
      %p
        An elf, if feeling introspective – and when aren't they? – may speak of Heaven.
        This may be the only religious belief elves have: that when they achieve
        perfect enlightenment, they will leave Near and enter perfect oneness, when the
        illusion of Near disappears for them, and they see it for what it is, their own
        dream. This Heaven is as horrific of an idea to a human as it sounds – the elf
        sees himself as the dreamer of everything and everyone else, and he will take
        his true place in Heaven.
      %p
        Elven magic manifests itself in other minor forms, however. Elven AURAS are
        very powerful Secrets and have many special abilities that protect the elf and
        project its will on others. The long age of an elf seems like magic to other
        peoples, as well: elves can draw on their many experiences to perform nearly
        any feat.

          Elves do not usually practice craft skills, as their aura tends to have a
          strange effect on any equipment they carry on their person or handle regularly.
          Such items take on a part of the Elven aura, slowly becoming more perfect and
          ethereal versions of them. This can happen at Story Guide discretion
          spontaneously, but to control it in any way, the elf needs the SECRET OF AURA
          IMBUEMENT.
        %p
          When imbuing an item, an aura smith does not make a distinction between mundane
          and magical effects; an Elven item may well have extraordinary abilities. The
          elf can only set ratings for things he has experienced and imbue Secrets he
          himself has known, however, aside from IMBUEMENTS that are only available for
          items. Specifically, all aurasmithed items have the ELVEN IMBUEMENT.
        %p
          Elven items all have an aura recognizably similar to that of the item’s

          mundane version of itself. An item with multiple ELVEN IMBUEMENTS has an even
          stronger aura and might even develop rudimentary sentience.

          appropriately enough, disappearing from the world.

      %p
        When the Sky Fire fell to Near, all elves disappeared. Not a single one was
        seen for over two hundred years. As to where they went, no one knows, not even
        the elves. Elves' stories are varied: most purport that they were always here
        and have no memory of leaving or those two hundred years, while others speak of
        Far, another world they are able to visit.
      %p
        Whatever happened, elves are loathe to speak of it. Since they have returned,
        though, it is obvious the Shadow Moon has had an effect on them. Once elves
        were friendly towards each other, greeting other ones on the path to
        enlightenment. Once, when an elf was asked about the logical fallacy in two
        elves both thinking the universe is their dream, he said, “It is not known
        whether I am dreaming him dreaming the world, or he is dreaming me dreaming the
        world. Either way, we'd better get along”. Now, though, Elven friendliness is
        rare, and most elves despise the sight of another one. The power struggle to
        see who truly is the master of the dream has become intense. Some old elves
        blame the younger ones for the Sky Fire and Shadow Moon, claiming that too many
        competing for the dream has threatened to tear it apart.

          %dt Secret of the Elf
          %dd
            Elven bodies are formed from the aether by willpower alone. An elf that dies in
            Near returns within 28 days. The Story Guide and the player cooperate in
            choosing the time and the place; a story-relevant solution is preferred, but
            note that nobody has ever seen an elf rematerialize. The character loses a
            level from each Pool and a level from all Abilities, as the process of
            rematerialization is not perfect and the elf needs to readjust to his new body.
            The player can choose to have his character not return; in this case, however,
            the reason will not be established.
          %dt Past Lives (R)
          %dd
            This is the Elven Ability of remembering useful information from their
            countless past lives. It can be used to remember personal history and knowledge
            long lost. With time, an elf might even dredge up some useful Secrets or such.
          %dt Secret of the Polymath
          %dd
            In an elf’s long life, many Abilities have waxed and waned. Using this Secret
            allows the elf to use their PAST LIVES (R) in lieu of any other Ability they
            are physically capable of using. This lasts for the entire scene. Cost: 2
            REASON, and the next available Advance goes to improving the Ability used.
          %dt Secret of Enlightenment
          %dd
            The character Transcends, ascending to Heaven. The other players decide whether
            Near continues to exist. If it will, the character will not be heard of in Near
            anymore, but the player may opt to expend any of his Pools as bonus or penalty
            GIFT DICE for other characters as long as they last. Requirement: PAST LIVES
            (R) at Grandmaster.
          %dt Aura of Fading the Illusion
          %dd
            An elf with this secret can, through force of will, make the illusion of the
            world temporarily grow dim and ghostly outside his aura. To everyone else, it
            appears the elf has become translucent and incorporeal. This lasts for one
            scene, during which the character can pass through the smallest crack and
            cannot be harmed physically. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Aura of Protection
          %dd
            The character’s aura grows thick and smothering, protecting him softly from the
            external world. The elf can spend REASON to lower incoming physical Harm. Cost:
            1 REASON per step lowered.
          %dt Aura of the Imperator
          %dd
            The character’s aura waxes as he enforces his will, making him appear taller
            and more majestic. The opposing player has no input into the stakes of this
            social conflict, which may cause the moment to resemble mindcontrol. Cost: 1
            Vigor
          %dt Aura of Sight
          %dd
            The character’s aura is no brighter from afar, but up close up it is bright
            enough to see in clearly.
          %dt Aura of the Ancient
          %dd
            The character’s aura has a calm frisson. He can use CHARM (I) to calm down
            animals, and giants with temper have to overcome him in a direct contest of
            wills to act against his wishes.
          %dt Aura of the Tower
          %dd
            The character’s aura is polarized, giving it a weird dark-and-light flavor.
            Passive Abilities are now all associated with the character’s current strongest
            Pool.
          %dt Aura of the Lunar Sphere
          %dd
            The character has an affinity with the Moon. He suffers a penalty die to all
            social checks towards other elves, and cannot Transcend. When the character
            dies, he returns to Near during the next night. He does not lose Abilities;
            instead, he loses this Secret. Cost: 2 INSTINCT to return via the Moon.
          %dt Secret of Aura Imbuement
          %dd
            The character’s aura is strong enough to influence any equipment the character
            carries on his person or handles on a regular basis. The character can create
            rated or imbued equipment in this way from ordinary items, which slowly grow
            towards perfection in the elf’s hands; instead of an Ability check, the elf
            slowly invests into the item, one xp per scene, until he’s happy with it. All
            items developed by this Secret have the ELVEN IMBUEMENT for free. Cost: 1
            EXPERIENCE POINT per a point of quality imbued into the item, and 2 xp per
            Secret.
          %dt Secret of Aura Smithing
          %dd
            A skilled aura smith can further improve on the process: an appropriate
            crafting Ability check allows the character to immediately improve the item
            with the check result in xp (he himself pays only to activate this Secret,
            note). This can be done only once per month. Cost: 2 EXPERIENCE POINTS.

          %dt Elven Imbuement
          %dd
            All Elven items have an Elven aura. Any elf who is familiar with the item and
            at peace with its creator gains a 1 point discount to the Pool costs of any
            imbuements in the item. This imbuement can be stacked on an item, which
            increases the discount and also gives a 1 point discount to non-elves at peace
            with the creator.
          %dt Memory Imbuement (Ability, level)
          %dd
            The item has a memory of how it was used by its creator, at one level under the
            creator’s Ability. The current user can loan these memories to make an Ability
            check at the level stored in the item. The effect lasts for the whole scene
            once activated. Cost: 1 REASON per level of Ability, and the next available
            Advance goes to improving the Ability used. Requirement: ELVEN IMBUEMENT
          %dt Ego Imbuement
          %dd
            An item with this Imbuement has developed a self-identity of the sort you’d
            expect from magical talking swords or such. It doesn’t necessarily talk,
            however; the item can only do the things it has Abilities for, as determined by
            the MEMORY IMBUEMENT, which it uses for free. Ego items do not normally have
            Pools or Keys, but can use those of their operator. The item has no limit to
            its number of Imbuements. Requirement: two ELVEN IMBUEMENTS
          %dt Key of the Self
          %dd
            The character is an elf, a creature aloof and alone. 1xp: Ignore another
            person’s request to pursue your own goals. 3xp: Ignore someone in need to
            pursue your own goals. Buyoff: Become human by either dying to save another or
            creating life.
          %dt Key of the Eternal Question (specify)
          %dd
            There is a reason behind the illusion that is Near, and the character cannot
            have peace before knowing what it is. Pick a specific question, such as “Is
            individual virtue more important than communal well-being?” or “Why can’t I
            remember what happened to me at the south pole just before the Skyfire hit?”
            1xp: Obsess over the question. 3xp: Apply the question to your practical
            situation. Buyoff: Answer the question.
          %dt Key of Deja Vu
          %dd
            The character has experienced much, to the brink of ennui. 1xp: You’ve already
            experienced something that happens to you. 3xp: Your prior experience actually
            has an effect on the scene. Buyoff: Have a completely new experience.
          %dt Key of the Bloodline
          %dd
            No elf alive remembers their humanity, but some do know their bloodline, and
            watch their distant descendants with interest. 1xp: Observe your bloodline.
            2xp: Help your kin. 5xp: Help your bloodline continue. Buyoff: Reveal yourself
            to your family.
          %dt Key of Lifespan
          %dd
            The character cherishes the life he has now, here. He does not want to forget
            it, not even a little bit. 1xp: Enjoy the life you have built for yourself.
            3xp: Defend your position and gains you’d lose if you had to leave. Buyoff: Die

        “Elves are assholes” is a joking dictum that’s been developed through my own

        Still, everybody is a person, and so are the elves. I’ve seen amiable ones and
        even those that seek to actively do good. The last ones are most strained by
        their identity, as the question is awful: when you are dedicated to an eternal
        mission, is there anything in the world worth your sacrifice? Saving another
        person, even a good one, would mean nothing in comparison to your own eternity,
        whatever the cause you serve.
      %p
        Elves tend to be wanderers who don’t really call any land or culture their own.

      A goblin is a small, twisted creature. A human would call it debased, for it
      has neither values nor restraint. The goblin would not understand those terms:
      it is a creature of hedonistic pleasure, living for this moment, and the next.
    %p
      Goblins are infinitely adaptable beings; their “natural” bodies, if you can
      call them that, manage to resemble demons, dogs, and men at the same time. They
      are mottled brown, black, green, and grey, and their hair grows randomly, in
      shape and color. Their bodies have an ability that cannot be explained by many:
      they evolve to match their environment even as they continue to age, and their
      offspring carry these same characteristic. Even strong magic and torture can
      warp their bodies, as many evil wizards have found, creating the dread
      urgoblins, bugbears, Hungry Ones and Violators from goblin stock. Most goblins
      are smaller and stouter than humans, although they can come in just about any
      size.
    %p
      Goblins' curiosity drives them into all the forgotten places of the earth, and
      makes them decent apprentices for just about any job: they catch on quickly,
      but tend to cause as many accidents as they do help. They're easy to keep
      loyal, though: all goblins have an addiction, which if fed regularly, will make
      one your best friend. This addiction need not be to a drug: they can be
      addicted to a certain act, food, drink, or any experiences, really. (A tale has
      been told of goblin divers on the shores of Maldor. These beasts were amazing
      pearl-finders, and were addicted to the rush of adrenaline they got when their
      human handler threw them off the cliff-side.)
    %p
      Goblin tribes can be found all over Near, and goblins may also easily live with

          Goblins are all gripped by addictions that control much of their being, even
          being addicted to things that are in no way alluring to humans. The character
          does not pay Advances for the SECRET OF ADDICTION. The Story Guide may require
          Resist (R) checks from a goblin to avoid developing new addictions to
          experiences they encounter; each existing and active addiction provides a bonus
          die to resisting new ones.

          Goblins can change their body structure and even their mental build over time,

          Ability can be used to perform feats of contortionism, both actual and

          with enough motivation.
        %dt Secret of Adaptability

          The character can change himself quickly and drastically to conform better with
          his current environment. When indulging an addiction, instead of regaining

          In lieu of the normal activation of the SECRET OF ADAPTABILITY the character

          to the same very quickly. An ADAPTABILITY (V) check result determines how many

          While other goblins usually do not warp into new form, the character adapts all
          but instantly. Furthermore, he may trigger an adaptation cycle at will. There
          is a downside: the Story Guide may cause an adaptation cycle to trigger when
          conditions suddenly change, should the character fail an ENDURE (V) check to
          control himself; if the addiction can’t be immediately satisfied, this costs

          Ghouls almost always are addicted to the flesh of dead people; each time they

      %p
        Left alone, goblin societies resemble anarchy to any outsider, although they
        tend to grow an alpha goblin among any tribe. Any goblin tribe of more than
        about two dozen of the animals tends to fall apart without an outside master,
        usually human. Goblins are actually rather good at organizing to make sure
        everyone's needs get met, but when they start to threaten each other's
        resources, tribes quickly split into rivals.
      %p
        Goblin families are very loose-knit. All goblins are poly-sexual, and any
        mating between them, whether male-male, male-female, or female-female, can
        generate offspring. With a month-long gestation period, this doesn't really get
        in the way of their curious relations.
      %p
        The goblin offspring are born as small, but capable goblinets, emerging as
        little flesh-balls about a foot in diameter. Within an hour of their birth,
        they grow feet, hands, eyes, and a mouth. Young goblinets pick another goblin
        in the tribe as their parent, randomly, and if that goblin doesn't push them
        away, they usually learn the same addictions and behaviors. Should it become an
        issue, goblinets begin the game with minimal Pools, their few Abilities at
        MEDIOCRE (0) and the KEY OF GOBLINET.
      %p
        Goblins do not understand the human concept of love. It's an alien concept to
        them. They do understand mutual pleasure, of both the sexual and non-sexual
        form, and do actively work with each other. The greatest sins in goblin society
        are not wanting to trade – one goblin's poison is another's pudding – and
        betraying someone you're working with.
      %p
        A few goblins have been observed in a bizarre state that resembles love,
        however. When a goblin is struck with this, known only as “the Affliction” in
        their rough language, they leave their tribe and travel, their only goals to
        prove their love or die. (They seem confused by their own emotions, and usually
        cannot express clearly what they are doing.) A goblin has never been observed
        in love with another goblin, however; they always choose a member of another
        species as their object of affection, almost always a human.
      %p
        A goblin who buys off the KEY OF AFFLICTION becomes human. They lose their
        Adaptability and goblin-specific Secrets (losing the Advances), but may not
        necessarily lose all of their current adaptations; such a person may be left
        stuck in a liminal state as they are unable to shapeshift.

      %p
        Goblin adaptability makes them a creature on par with humanity in terms of
        variation. Different conditions – and sometimes, cultures – force the goblins
        to take shapes quite far from what might be considered their natural one. It’s
        pretty fun to develop these critters from traditional fantasy memes; here are
        some examples:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Apes
        %dd
          are what goblins are called in the jungles of Qek. They live in troops deep in
          the jungle, usually staying out of the way of the humans. Individual troops
          will almost always include a seamless extent of speaking and tool-using
          critters, as well as those that are little but dumb animals.
        %dt Orcs
        %dd
          are big, savage goblins that have sprung up in northern Maldor and Ammeni
          through the recent years. They are cruel, addicted to the by-products of war
          ravaging their homelands. Orcs seem to develop spontaneously in goblin tribes,
          but at their worst they are in the Ammeni mercenary outfits, made up entirely
          of orcs.
        %dt Ghouls
        %dd
          are goblins as well, gaunt as they may be. Ghouls apparently developed during
          the Year of Shadow and quickly specialized in scavenging the flesh of the
          multitudes that perished. Now they haunt battlefields and cemeteries in Maldor.
          Despite the environs and diet, most ghouls are gentle and curious creatures not
          likely to attack living beings.
        %dt Trolls
        %dd
          are what goblins are called in Gorenite lands. There are also actual trolls:
          strong, enormous, thickskinned rulers of troll-kin. It is far from clear why
          there are so many trolls in Goren of all places.
        %dt Spriggan
        %dd
          is what goblins are called in Khale. They’re shy creatures that live up in
          trees and down under their roots. They can change their coloring to match the
          environment, making them quite reclusive.
        %dt Yeti
        %dd
          is the name Vulflanders give to goblins. Vulfland goblins have thick, warm fur
          and an ability to hibernate for extended periods. They live in subterranean or
          glacial labyrinths they trap against their Vulfen predators.
        %dt Deep Ones
        %dd
          are water-breathing goblins, of course. I imagine they’d interact with
          land-lubbers near coasts and in the archipelagos. Their undersea skirmishes
          with the Talalag of Pere-di-Fey must be a sight to behold.
        %dt Imps
        %dd
          are a particular type of goblin in Ammeni, the sort that is especially suited
          for specialized tasks in harmony with their form and addictions. The definition
          is really just functional, a useless goblin is a “pest” instead. Creating imps
          is something of an art-form among some more debased House nobles, who pride
          themselves on their ability of reducing a person into a flesh automaton.

    %p
      %em Adapted from forum discussions with Josh and Troels.
    %p
      Dwarves are a reclusive and strange species, more likely to delve underground
      than make demands of other creatures for their share of Near. Humans and other
      creatures are untrustworthy to the dwarves; this could not be otherwise, for a
      dwarf is all but incapable of betrayal.
    %p
      A dwarf resembles a human, at least slightly. It is stockier and thicker, and
      bent, getting more so as age catches up on it over the decades. Were a dwarf
      able to stand tall, it might reach a man up to his shoulderblades.
    %p
      Dwarves are creatures of tradition and purpose; purpose to change the world,
      tradition to constrain and regulate the limitless passion, turning it into
      patience and a heritage. Dwarven community is like a cornucopia of strange
      mystery cults scattered all over the world, cults that recognize each other by
      secret languages, signs and tradition.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#dwarven-rings{:name => "dwarven-rings"} Dwarven Rings
      %p
        Dwarves live for their community, most of the time. A dwarf calls his social
        ties “rings”, as they connect dwarves to each other and intersect to create the
        mesh of larger community. Humans are rarely accepted by dwarven rings, other
        species even less often.
      %p
        The first ring for any dwarf is his FAMILY, the immediate working unit that
        stands or falls together. All family members know their place in the family;
        the one with the most respect is called the family ALDER, who speaks for them
        all. Disobedience towards the alder is certain to split the family.
      %p
        When several families find it well to cooperate, they form a CLAN, ruled by a
        THANE. Just like family members have their places in a family, families have in
        a clan. Additionally, individual dwarves may hold a place in the thane’s ring
        as clansmen, which might afford them greater prestige than merely being a
        member of a family within the clan.
      %p
        This series of rings goes up to DOMAINS, ruled by KINGS, and finally the
        FEDERATION, ruled by the HIGH KING himself. Not only has the dwarven
        federation, parallel to the Empire of Maldor, disintegrated into kinstrife, but
        most if not all dwarven domains have also been lost; only clans and scattered
        families remain in Near today.
      %p
        Aside from the vertical organization of family rings, dwarves also organize
        laterally into GUILDS, ruled by the GUILDMASTER. The guildmaster is like an
        alder, except that his ring is not connected by blood, but by craft. A single
        dwarf can belong in several guilds as long as he has the time for it; the
        SECRET OF DWARF limits how many rings the character can have without additional
        Secrets.
      %p
        The smallest dwarven ring, and the most infamous, is that of BROTHERHOOD: in
        some specific circumstances a dwarven character might be obligated to offer the
        highest privilege to a friend or ally. This practice, while unavoidable in many
        legends, is a cause of great disruption and concern for dwarven society, and is
        therefore frowned upon when offered lightly.
      %p
        In practice the dwarven rings make for a seclusive community. When dwarves live
        in human towns, they do so in their own quarters. When they live in the wild,
        they form their homesteads in places hard to reach, if at all possible. Often a
        dwarven ring has an assigned speaker whose job it is to deal with humans and
        anybody else other strangers who do not belong in rings; this is considered a
        very stressful task, fraught with unseen danger.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#ordination-to-purpose{:name => "ordination-to-purpose"} Ordination to Purpose
      %p
        The central function of dwarven rings is to practice ORDINATION, the
        prioritization of dwarven wills in the rightful manner. Ordination is always
        between two dwarves, always explicit, but it is transitive: those who are
        lesser than I are also lesser than any towards whom I am the lesser. A dwarf of
        lesser ordination is expected to defer to the greater in all things, as that is
        what ordination means. Ordination is normally permanent, making older dwarves
        very likely to establish ordination towards younger ones at a very early age;
        only conflicting ordinations through multiple rings cause dwarves to re-examine
        the ordination of individuals. Dwarves of separate rings cannot normally
        negotiate ordination, which makes them strangers.
      %p
        As to why dwarves need these stringent structures, it is because of their
        PURPOSE, the mental state of each dwarf individually. Dwarves are by nature
        fanatics, each focusing on a single purpose to the exclusion of everything
        else. The ordination into rings makes it possible for the dwarves to interact
        and cooperate meaningfully with those whose interests coincide with theirs. A
        dwarf whose purpose does not brook ordination to their family often becomes
        outcast and either finds a new family or learns to live on his own.
      %p
        What all of this comes to is that dwarven families all over Near vary widely in
        their goals, lifestyle and philosophy. This may lead to a greater and greater
        seclusion for those families that do not have reasonable contact with other,
        amiable families. As most dwarves are keenly aware of the dangers of incest,
        this becomes an issue: it is not unknown for dwarves to steal human children to
        raise as their own, or to arrange for dwarfmeets wherein families with
        perpendicular interests exchange babies. This whole issue is a major reason for
        starting a clan or even a domain.
      %p
        Dwarves wield no magics foreign to men, but their mind-set is perhaps all the
        more alien. Dwarven rings live in a tension that demands absolute fealty from
        individuals whose first instinct is to trust nobody with their secrets and
        goals. They often have secret languages that are trained and memorized by
        habit, all the better to protect the secrets and purpose of the family. Dwarven
        equipment is often superior to anything else, and often much too cumbersome,
        complex or delicate for a human to use effectively.
      .section
        %h4
          %a#rituals{:name => "rituals"} Rituals
        %p
          Dwarven rings often practice various RITUALS, complex and codified surrogate
          actions towards definite goals. Mechanically rituals are exactly like equipment
          – invocation costs, equipment ratings and all – except that they are immaterial
          instead of being items. Dwarves do not distinguish much between a ritual and a
          piece of equipment: craftsmen of material make tools for a purpose, while
          craftsmen of the mind make tools for the mind. Such is typical for musicians,
          speakers, priests and storytellers, but nearly any Ability can be the basis of
          a ritual concerning its own slice of life.
        %p
          Each ritual is designed for a particular ring tongue, without which it cannot
          be understood. A character can teach a ritual to another if both succeed in
          FAMILIA (R) checks and belong in the same ring that has a ring tongue through
          which the particular ritual can be transmitted and used. A ritual smith can
          modify a ritual he knows with appropriate Ability checks, paying for the
          changes just like if he was creating a new ritual.
        %p
          A ritual always has a definite interval at which it needs to be repeated for
          the benefits to remain with the dwarf. When designing new rituals, consider
          making the ritual’s requirements or drawbacks more severe for rituals that do
          not require as much repetition.
    .section

        %a#living-for-a-reason{:name => "living-for-a-reason"} Living for a Reason
      %p
        Dwarves lived traditionally below-ground, in places others would not want or
        need. Through the latter years of the Empire of Maldor the dwarven domains
        unified in purpose as well, forming a strange parallel society largely hidden
        from human view. At this time trade and cooperation with humans was at its
        height as well, resulting in the underground domains (the original meaning of
        the word) becoming some of the most beautiful and prosperous cities in all of
        Maldor.
      %p
        The Shadow brought a time of disunity and kin strife to the dwarves as those
        individuals, families and even clans obsessed with the Skyfire and the science
        of astrology flew into confusion and rage. Trade relations with surface people
        deteriorated and underground domains were abandoned as families scattered to
        sustain themselves without trade. The federation was lost as the High King
        passed into darkness.
      %p
        Today many dwarves still insist on living underground, even if it is hard: an
        individual family is little better than a rodent in its hole, with cold and
        dirty environs that protect them from the world. Underground clans have more
        reasonable arrangements, but still most dwarves today end up living with people
        in their own walled enclaves or homesteads away from the human village. For
        most this is not a bad life, despite their inborn distrust of humanity: dwarven
        craftsmen and other specialists, all according to their purpose, certainly have
        their place in most parts of Near.
      %p
        Sometimes a dwarf stops to reflect on his ultimate, perfect fidelity of
        purpose. Sometimes the scales even balance against continuing a life of
        austerity among people who might not even be friends, despite being family.
        Such dwarves might seek to escape the life, although the risks are high: most
        dwarven communities tell stories of the horrible, twisted PETTY-DWARVES,
        creatures crushed under the burden of purpose without the support of their
        family. Even if this does not deter the would-be apostate, they probably know
        that each and every one of their rings will do something to get them back.
      %p
        Provided that their family does not retrieve them and they manage to buy off
        the KEY OF APOSTASY, escaping dwarves become human. Such characters forget any
        dwarven languages they had in time (unless preserved by SECRET OF LANGUAGE) and
        lose their position in dwarven rings (losing the Advances invested). They even
        gain height and walk more upright when they are no longer burdened by purpose.

            The character belongs in a number of dwarven rings at most equal to a FAMILIA

            determine ordinance with his ring-fellows, and may share Pools with them by
            simple companionship. Players may assume for simplicity’s sake that a character
            has a FAMILIA (R) check’s worth of points available in this manner at any given
            time; the obligation runs both ways, though.
          %dt Familia (R)
          %dd
            Knowledge of family history and values is of utmost importance to a dwarf.
            Aside from knowledge checks, this Ability is used to determine ORDINATION
            within a dwarven family. Ideological issues and family policy are also debated
            mostly with this Ability.
          %dt Secret of Purpose
          %dd
            The character has a personal PURPOSE in harmony with those of his rings. He may

          %dt Secret of Alder
          %dd
            The character is the head of a family of dwarves, forming a family ring. By
            definition, he needs to have the highest ordination, others are expected to
            either relinquish ordination to him or leave the family. The alder phrases the
            family’s overall purpose. Requirements: SECRET OF PURPOSE
          %dt Secret of Guildmaster
          %dd
            The character is the head of a dwarven guild. Guilds are like families, except
            that they count ordination with an appropriate craft Ability instead of FAMILIA
            (R). A dwarf may belong in both a family and a guild, and a guild may have
            members of several families. The guildmaster is treated like an alder for the
            purposes of other crunch if the guild has members of several families; like a
            thane if it has members from several clans and so on. Requirements: SECRET OF
            PURPOSE
          %dt Secret of Thane
          %dd
            The character leads several dwarven families as a thane, forming a clan ring.
            Alders of the clan automatically belong in the clan ring and determine family
            ordination against each other and individual dwarves in the clan ring; dwarves
            in the clan families may use this family ordination when they do not have any
            mutual rings. Requirements: SECRET OF PURPOSE, three alders willing to obey the
            thane.
          %dt Secret of Brotherhood (person)
          %dd
            The character shares his ordination with another; the two characters are
            considered of equal ordination, a concept otherwise unknown to dwarven society.
            The target of brotherhood may make free use of the rings of this character; the
            two are considered spiritually and legally same by other dwarves, to such an
            extent that one killing the other would not be seen as murder, but as
            self-amputation.
          %dt Secret of True Brothers (person)
          %dd
            The two characters are bonded not only in form, but in spirit as well. Either
            may use the other’s Secrets when the two are together, and now both characters
            can use the rings of either character interchangeably. Cost: 1 POOL appropriate
            to the Secret. Requirement: the target has a matching SECRET OF BROTHERHOOD.
          %dt Secret of Ring Tongue (specify)
          %dd
            The character has invented a secret language supporting a particular ring’s
            purpose. The player gets to choose one Ability that gains a bonus die to all
            characters that learn the language. Members of the ring learn it automatically
            within a year and a day of its release at the latest, and need no Secrets to
            know it. Others need the SECRET OF LANGUAGE.
          %dt Secret of Ringcraft
          %dd
            The character has learned secrets that are not even expressible in natural
            languages, which lack the necessary grammar. He can create equipment and
            rituals using any Ability a ring tongue of his supports, just like if he had
            the SECRET OF CREATION. All equipment created by him has the DWARVEN IMBUEMENT
            for free.
          %dt Dwarven Imbuement (language)
          %dd
            All dwarven items have this imbuement, reflecting their stark, alien function.
            The item’s creator chooses one ring tongue for which the equipment has been
            designed; users of that ring tongue pay any introduction costs the item has
            only once per session, instead of per scene. An item may have this imbuement
            several times to make it usable for several languages.
          %dt Secret of the Wondersmith (theme)
          %dd
            The character has become a master of his craft, creating new things in
            obsession. Equipment and rituals created by the character do not need to be
            mundane, and may in fact be built to use any Secret mechanics in the game as
            long as they follow the THEME: the wondersmith has to choose a particular
            material, topic or function he specializes in, and all of his wondrous

            The war-dance of this dwarven clan in Qek helps them remove the heads of the
            unworthy to store zamani in. It allows the dwarf to use the SECRET OF SUDDEN
            STRIKE. The ritual remains in effect until the next time the dwarf sleeps.
            Ratings: +3 for removing the heads of the wicked. +2 for removing heads. +1 for

        Dwarves are a minority even among their own kind. I imagine them as crazy
        survivalists, cultists, esoteric experts of forgotten arts. A dwarven family
        could form the kernel of a human organization – and that organization could
        even have heroic goals. Perhaps this would justify the state of the dwarf.
      %p
        My own favorite dwarves live burrowed in certain white cliffs on the southern
        continental coastline. They are the Domain of Kruse, just about the last
        dwarven Domain in Near, thanks to how they closed themselves away from the
        world when the Skyfire came. The whole domain is dedicated to Luxembourgian
        revolutionary communism, which makes them relatively nice when compared to the
        average sort of foreign colonist in Near. The fearsome thing is that their
        social model works for them, being dwarves, and they don’t mind sharing the
        system with others. Fun times.
      %p
        Goren is as much of a haven for dwarves as it is for the other critters;
        dwarven smith families are core value for the guild towns of Old Goren, and
        people know more or less how to handle the dwarves thanks to numerous lays that
        tell about heroes, magic rings and what dwarves do to you if you commission
        magical artifacts and don’t pay for them.
      %p
        Any place in Near is good for dwarves, considering how esoteric their purposes
        can get and what sort of lifestyles they’re willing to adopt. There hasn’t been
        much play yet, but I’ve heard about dwarven scholars in the Lost Academy,
        farmer communities in the Oranide hills, rebel survivalists on the Abandoned
        Coast of Maldor, religious fanatic dwarves of all seven sorts and so on and so
        forth.

    %p
      Giants, as the name implies, are a large, human-like species scattered all over
      Near. They vary widely in size from ten-foot brutes to beings capable of
      felling mammoths by hand. Stories tell of even larger giants, big enough to
      cast a shadow over a whole city and strong enough to lift castles off the
      ground.
    %p
      Giants do not look pretty: their musculature knots like tree roots under their
      skin, with bones jutting at unpractical angles. Thick layers of dirt cake them
      where their arms can’t reach to keep them clean; sometimes vegetation grows
      directly on their thick, unfeeling skin. Most are hairy and naked by necessity.
      Still, the lumbering creature works even as it creaks, rising with an
      earthquake to shout its rage.

        Giants are rare creatures, as often born of the Human Equation as naturally;
        they do start families, but only in the most distant parts of the world, such
        as the Roof of the World or Vulfland tundra. Elsewhere a giant is much more
        likely to be hunted down long before he meets his match.
      %p
        This is not to say that people are hostile towards giants; for most they are
        little more than stories of far past, so rare these creatures are. Giants are
        not essentially hostile, either – they have a human-like intelligence and
        aesthetic, they enjoy the same thing humans do.
      %p
        What makes this association so painful and impossible is the size of the giant,
        both physically and psychologically: giants eat a lot and often have little
        patience or care for those smaller than themselves. Stories know to warn of
        this: giants are depicted as buffoons or hostile rogues in many places. Living
        with the “little people” is simply too much of a challenge for most. Think of
        KING KONG, that’s the sort of thing you’d get most of the time trying to
        interact with a giant.

          %dd
            Giants are much larger than most people. When a giant can make his size count
            in conflict, he can annul the result by flexing himself; this does not by
            itself cause a simple conflict to extend, but if it does, the opposition cannot
            benefit from SURPRISE bonus dice. However, there is a price: the giant heals
            slowly, and any Harm he has at the end of extended conflict goes up one step
            (to a maximum of MORTAL (6)) instead of shaking down. Cost: check difference in
            Vigor to shake off the result.
          %dt Secret of Bulk
          %dd
            The character has an extra level in his Harm track, sharing a number with an
            existing level. This Secret can be gained multiple times. The first extra level
            is Mortal, the second Major, the third Minor, and repeat; the extra levels are
            distributed evenly to numbers in their categories.
          %dt Stature (V)
          %dd
            This Ability reflects the giant’s size, and his skill at using his size
            effectively. We don’t usually measure giant size in feet or meters; rather, a
            check of this Ability can be used to find out if a giant is “large enough” for
            a given purpose. I’m thinking of things like ripping trees from their roots or
            lifting a person on a rooftop. The Ability is also useful as support in
            anything where large size and strength would be of use.
          %dt Secret of Soft Touch
          %dd
            The character has learned to restrain himself when interacting with lesser
            creatures. His STATURE associates with INSTINCT as well, and he can buy penalty
            dice for it as well as bonus dice, should he wish to intentionally reduce the
            impact of his size on the environment.
          %dt Secret of Temper
          %dd
            The character has awakened his AURA. The character can shake off any social or
            magical compulsion by going into a rage; this does not by itself cause a simple
            conflict to extend, but if it does, the opposition cannot benefit from SURPRISE
            bonus dice. However, there is a price: anybody refreshing Pools with the giant
            is prone to suffer Harm equal to a STATURE (V) check when interacting
            intimately with his unrestrained nature; a REACT (I) check from the victim can
            be used to reduce the amount of Harm. Cost: check difference in Instinct to
            shake off the result.
          %dt Secret of Chaos Aura
          %dd
            The character’s very movement causes a disturbance within his aura. Elven auras
            are suppressed in the presence of the giant, unless the elf succeeds in a
            RESIST (R) check against his STATURE (V). When the character rages, others
            nearby have to make REACT (I) checks against his STATURE (V) to regain their

          %dt Secret of the Evil Eye
          %dd
            The character’s eye holds such power that it kills on sight. Using the eye
            enables mortal stakes in conflict. A RESIST (R) check against his STATURE (V)
            may be used to resist. The eye cannot be turned off. Requirement: SECRET OF
            TEMPER
          %dt Secret of Colossal Size
          %dd
            The character is of an older breed, of a clearly larger scale than the average
            giant. He can feasibly use his STATURE (V) for Gulliver-style feats, such as
            damming rivers with his body. He also has superior LEVERAGE in conflicts where
            his size matters; he wins wrestling matches and such automatically against
            lesser creatures. However, the colossal giant does not recover normally: he
            cannot use natural healing or plain Ability checks to heal Harm. Requirements:
            SECRET OF TEMPER, more SECRET OF BULK than any other character in the campaign

          %dt Secret of Deep Sleep
          %dd
            The character’s rest is deep and healing. By forgoing a refreshment opportunity
            and sleeping instead, he can shake down all of his Harm and make a STATURE (V)
            check to heal a level. Waking up to disturbance requires a RESIST (R) check.
          %dt Secret of the Sleep of Seasons
          %dd
            The giant can go into a long, deep sleep. The sleeping giant is considered a
            part of the landscape by the fauna and flora, and will not care for sustenance
            nor conditions of his environment while he sleeps. The sleeping giant can
            awaken by being Harmed or with a successful REACT (I) check in reaction to
            considerable disturbance; otherwise he continues sleeping indefinitely. The
            sleeping giant is healed of all Harm, and will not need sleep afterwards for
            however long the sleep of seasons lasted. Requirements: SECRET OF TEMPER,
            SECRET OF DEEP SLEEP.
          %dt Secret of the Giant Dream
          %dd
            The giant’s dream world is somewhat real, reflecting his experiences and
            knowledge welling from deep inside. The character may have normal scenes framed
            for him within his dream, in which he is human and not a giant. Anything may
            happen to the character mechanically in the dream, except that dying in the

        %a#adult-temper{:name => "adult-temper"} Adult Temper
      %p
        Giants vary in size quite a bit, usually growing larger as they get older.
        Giants themselves do not look at size as the first thing, however: rather, a
        giant is only considered an adult once his TEMPER awakens.
      %p
        A giant’s Temper is not quite a natural thing from a human viewpoint: rather,
        it’s the awakening of the giant’s inhuman lusts and yearnings, like a beast
        within. Some giants fear their temper, and for a reason: it is not always
        controllable.
      %p
        An unawakened giant is much like a large human. When the Temper awakens,
        however, the giant gains an AURA of sorts: natural forces start manifesting
        around him, especially when he gets angry. The aura is a dark one, not easy to
        see; many would mistake it for grime or body hair, except when the giant rages
        and it crawls all over him. The aura magic provides the giant with elemental,
        brute power unmatched in this world.
      %p
        Born giants from the fringes of the world might sometimes talk of how they see
        themselves and their Temper. It is often a wistful story, one that touches on
        the First and the Ancient: when the world was made all was well, but ever since
        then people have started seeing farther and farther, which has made for less
        and less space for giants, who grow smaller and smaller, straining their Temper
        more and more. The First had no Temper, for they were permitted to grow as
        large as they would and could. What any of this means, I doubt a giant could
        say.

      %p
        Giants do not grow old, or at least there is no proof of such. They do,
        however, grow tired. As a giant grows larger and older he heals slower and
        needs more food and sleep. Ultimately, the giant may go into a long-term
        hibernation known as the sleep of seasons. This may last years, decades – even
        centuries, if the giant is not disrupted and he needs the time to heal. Earth
        and vegetation gather quickly to cover these giants; in fact, their own skin
        sheds and provides a starting point for the protective coloration. The breath
        and heart of such a giant slow down to such an extent that it may easily be
        mistaken for dead.
      %p
        Many places in modern Near are known as spots where a giant has presumably
        fallen, often during the chaos of the Skyfire or the Year of Shadow.
        Superstitious people tread lightly in these places, in fear of awakening the
        giant sleeping within the crust. Others seek these places in the hopes of
        awakening a powerful servant. Some worship giants, such as the eponymous King
        Khale of the Khaleans.
      %p
        A sleeping giant seems inactive, but this is not quite so: the giant dream is
        powerful and may influence the world in different ways. The most dramatic event
        is when the sleeping giant happens upon an AVATAR, a representative it contacts
        to advocate for itself in the waking world.
      %p
        A different form of the sleep of seasons is the sleep of rebirth, which may
        happen for dying giants who possess the Key of Temper. Unless his body is
        concernedly destroyed (not a mean task), the death of a giant may be near
        indistinguishable from his sleep. In time, the giant may awaken from this
        dream, provided that he succeeds in a STATURE (V) check: if he bought off the
        KEY OF TEMPER when he died, this rebirth happens in human form: the stony form
        of the dead giant opens to reveal the man inside. Such a character loses access
        to his giant crunch (not recovering Advances) and continues as a mortal.
        However, should a giant die in rage, he will only awaken from the sleep of
        death as a ONE-EYE, a dead, stony apparition driven by the giant’s unspoken
        appetite. Should a character not awake at all, the player decides when to let
        the dreaming afterlife of his character lapse.
      %p
        I should mention that there is one other way for a giant to become human
        through the KEY OF TEMPER buyoff: a giant who never rages will slowly diminish
        in size to match the people around him. This is a long and awkward process, but
        if he can build ties to a human community and keep his Temper in check, then a
        giant will one day find himself indistinguishable from the people around him.
        In practice I’d term this a QUEST if something is.

      %p
        One-Eyes are not properly characters; rather, they are echoes of true giants
        that have died, but refused to give way to new life. Such is the giant’s
        vitality that it animates earth and stone and weirder things to house the
        giant’s Temper. The One-Eye is an artificial colossus, a mockery of what the
        giant was like in life.
      %p
        One-Eyes, despite their origin, do not necessarily differ that much from living
        giants in their habits. If left in peace, they roam around, seemingly without
        aim, perhaps grabbing an animal and gnawing at it in imitation of hunger. They
        rest and wait as well, even if they need no sleep.
      %p
        A One-Eye can be dangerous to people who do not know what it is and provoke it;
        it has no morality, and it will not hesitate to squash small people under its
        bulk. Sometimes tragedies happen when a One-Eye ignores habitation and walks
        straight in, crushing everything in its way.
      %p
        One-Eyes were a much more common sight before the Skyfire, when Academy wizards
        of Maldor had found ways to influence them and even work them for the Empire.
        One-Eyes were once even collected and sent against the Hamouadi in a bid of
        desperation. This did not work too well, for the OneEyes then were tempestuous:
        whenever two of the kind would meet, they would fight to the utter destruction
        of both.
      %p
        When the Skyfire came, the One-Eyes all stopped moving as one. Soon they fell
        over and did not rise, becoming like the earth they came from. It’s taken
        centuries, but now these old One-Eyes are coming back, rising from the earth.
      %p
        One-Eyes today have an unspoken connection to each other. When rarely two of
        the kind should meet, they often start building structures, such as long walls
        that snake over the countryside, and stranger things besides. Nobody seems to
        know what they are doing.

        One-Eyes are not characters. In fact, they’re not even monsters like the
        forgotten dead, but more like furniture or natural phenomena. They are
        purposefully mysterious: whatever is going on with them, the answers are only
        found in play. I have my own theories, but I’m not telling.
      %p
        When a One-Eye is created, the giant’s last STATURE (V) check becomes an Effect
        that represents the One-Eye’s might. The player of the giant phrases the
        Effect, determining whatever scrap of the giant remains in his last creation.
        This Effect works exactly like any other, insofar as the rules are concerned.
        It just happens to be quite large in leverage, able to destroy fortresses that
        happen on its way. Characters will find it simple to destroy if they can match
        it’s rating with an appropriate Ability or outmaneuver it in some way.

        As the One-Eye is not an intentional creature, its Effect rating is only ever
        compared against a character’s check when the character gets directly in the
        One-Eye’s way. Otherwise the One-Eye mostly causes circumstance penalties or
        provokes simple Ability checks. In this regard it works exactly like a
        sandstorm or landslide or other natural disasters; in fact, the One-Eye is
        pretty much a fantasy disaster for the Story Guide’s toolbox.
      %p
        One-Eyes are more dangerous when they get numerous, especially now that they
        cooperate instead of fighting each other. There is a mud-flat in the eastern
        parts of the Sea of Teeth where a hundred One-Eyes struggle to break free from
        the slowly drying sea. When they do, who knows what they will do.

      %p
        Giants are usually encountered only one at a time. Were a character to meet a
        whole family, or a tribe, he’d know that he’s surely on one of the very edges
        of Near – Roof of the World, perhaps, or other places where giants can live in
        peace.
      %p
        In the civilized lands there is hardly any room for giants, whose bumbling
        ways, troublesome size and temperament are sure to make them enemies of
        organized government sooner or later. Merely existing among people of normal
        size is story enough for a giant; indeed, where giants have worked their feats
        of strength, they’ve rarely been anything but legendary figures.
      %p
        Goren is something of an exception to this rule in that the Gorenite Jošland
        has plenty of room for giants. Even in Old Goren probably half a dozen
        different families herd sheep in the frontier valleys and gorges of the Roof,
        journeying east to trade with Gorenite towns. The age-old ways tend to be
        disrupted by Highland Saints, however, as they have learned in the Roof to not
        trust in the goodwill of giants.

      %p
        Beastkin (anthropomorphized animals, furries – why not?) are mostly the same as
        humanite characters, mechanically. Each has a mandatory Secret that belongs to
        that creature only. They are not part of the Human Equation, however, and
        neither do they have any obvious relationship to each other, apart from the
        human-oriented view that they’re all “like animals”.
      %p
        Beastkin characters can access their own racial crunch, generic beastkin crunch
        and animal crunch freely. Like animals, the assumption is that a given
        character only gets the sort of crunch that fits its animal qualities – no
        SECRET OF SMALL SIZE for a large creature and so on.
      %p
        Beastkin are not psychologically or physically similar to humans like the old
        species are, so the Story Guide might well throw in some well-chosen
        circumstance penalties and such when the two breeds interact. Beastkin can
        refresh their Pools with animals of their own approximate type as well as
        people.

            Centaurs are large quadrupeds from the Great Plains, just my example of yet
            another Beastkin all but unknown in Near. They get a RUNNING (V) Ability and
            never run out of VIGOR: they always have one point left as long as they get
            enough to drink.

            These crocodile-men would be found in very small numbers in Qek; I’m told that
            they worship death gods in ancient temples there. They do not grow old, ever,
            and they grow larger and stronger with age, gaining Pool points.
          %dt Secret of Losing the Mind
          %dd
            A beastkin may make a BESTIALITY (V) check to fall into a seizure or frenzy
            that removes the check result in Advances from the Reason Pool, (R) Abilities
            and Secrets associated with intelligence. All but one (or two if even) of the
            Advances are immediately distributed between VIGOR and INSTINCT Pools. The
            change is permanent.
          %dt Secret of Animal Speech
          %dd
            Animals are actually not much for speaking, but whatever degree of
            communication they manage, this beastkin understands without Ability checks and
            regardless of prior experience with the animal in question. Most beastkin
            understand animals related to them naturally, but for others they need this
            Secret. Cost: 1 REASON
          %dt Secret of Moon Instinct
          %dd The character always knows where the Moon is, even if hidden. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
          %dt Bestiality (V)
          %dd
            Practically all animals have this Ability, depicting their ferocious,
            unthinking nature. It is useful when the animal has to overcome obstacles with
            pure force and speed. It’s not so much that this is the only important facet of
            being an animal; rather, we decide that dramatically the only reason animals
            are going to triumph in conflict is due to their being “good animals”,
            represented by this Ability.
          %dt Secret of Sociality
          %dd
            A social animal associates its BESTIALITY (V) with INSTINCT as well. It can
            engage in social conflicts over dominance, initiative and other cooperative
            issues.
          %dt Secret of Cunning
          %dd
            A cunning animal associates its BESTIALITY (V) with REASON as well. It can
            conflict over avoiding traps, understanding what happens around it and other
            such issues of rudimentary intelligence.
          %dt Secret of Tameness
          %dd
            A tame animal can refresh Pools like people. It can also learn the TRAINING (R)
            Ability.
          %dt Training (R)
          %dd
            A trained animal can support a person with this Ability. It can also try to
            understand human intent and fulfill tasks set to it by using its training.
          %dt Secret of Natural Weapons
          %dd
            An animal with this Secret has equipment ratings that depict its natural
            strengths, such as thick skin, teeth or wings. The “equipment quality” of the
            beast is established with a BESTIALITY (V) check, which may be rerolled in a
            refreshment scene. Natural weapons do not have imbuements.
          %dt Secret of Small Size
          %dd
            An animal with this Secret is smaller than a human, and thus gains a bonus die
            every time being small helps them; others gain a penalty die when the small
            size impedes their actions.
          %dt Secret of Great Size
          %dd
            An animal with this Secret is so big that it has STATURE (V), which it can use
            to overcome small obstacles with mere size. The animal can also get the SECRET
            OF BULK.
          %dt Secret of Flight
          %dd
            An animal with this Secret can fly. The cost is paid whether the animal flies
            or not. Cost: 1 VIGOR per scene
          %dt Secret of Nocturnality
          %dd
            An animal with this Secret is usually awake at night, and has adapted to
            low-light conditions. The animal associates all of its Abilities with INSTINCT
            at night-time and does not receive circumstance penalties for lack of light.
          %dt Secret of Man-killer
          %dd
            The animal does not fear people. When fighting with BESTIALITY (V) against a
            member of the old species, any Harm it causes is increased one step, but not
            over MORTAL (6). Requirement: has killed a person.
          %dt Secret of Trad Animal
          %dd
            The old TSoY rule for animals is to give them any Secrets that make sense for
            them, sort of like how item imbuements work. You can do that here as well: have
            the animal use its BESTIALITY (V) or TRAINING (R) or Passive Abilities instead
            of the Abilities the Secret requires, of course.
          %dt Key of the Predator
          %dd
            The animal is predatory by instinct. 1 Pool: Lurk or roam. 2 Pool: Attack prey.
            3 Pool: Attack an unusual prey.
          %dt Key of Herding
          %dd
            The animal likes to live among its own kind. 1 Pool: Remain with your herd. 2
            Pool: Follow the herd’s lead. 3 Pool: Defend the herd.
          %dt Key of Nocturnality
          %dd
            The animal prefers being active at night. 1 Pool: Be in a scene at night. 2
            Pool: Refuse to come out in daylight. 3 Pool: Feed or mate at night.

              The equipment has a separate Pool. This mostly makes sense for animals, but
              there are other places in the book for this as well. The Pool is one point in
              size and can be used whenever the character uses the equipment, as whichever
              type of Pool. It replenishes when the equipment is maintained.
            %dt Secret of Beastmaster
            %dd
              The character can tame normally untamable creatures with his ANIMAL KEN (I),
              forcing them to take the SECRET OF TAMENESS. He can also make any animal he
              tames a sidekick with the SECRET OF SIDEKICK regardless of Ability levels. When
              he tames an animal that doesn’t have established statistics, the player gets to
              allocate his check’s worth of Advances for the animal, while the Story Guide
              allocates twice that.
            %dt Secret of Behavior (specify)
            %dd
              The character gets along especially well with animals that have a certain

              of animal.
            %dt Key of the Animals

              The character likes animals a lot, perhaps even more than people. 1xp: Help an

        The fauna of Near is just as varied as you’d expect of a good and nice fantasy
        world. The environs of the Sea of Teeth are particularly rich in all sorts of
        life, but everywhere in Near there are animals fitting the environment; some
        even say that this is what Hanish gave Near, a living biosphere.
      %p
        Animals are not intentional creatures, so they don’t get Motivation Keys. What
        they do get are BEHAVIOR KEYS:
      %blockquote
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Behavior Key Framework
          %dd
            Keys of this type depict inborn instincts. 1 Pool: Fulfill your routine. 2
            Pool: Struggle to fulfill your routine. 3 Pool: Fulfill your routine despite
            exceptional circumstances.
      %p
        As can be seen, Behavior Keys do not provide experience points (and do not have
        a Buyoff condition) – instead, they provide Pool points for whichever Pool is
        running the lowest at the moment. This is useful for animals, as they get only
        one Pool point from a normal Pool refreshment.
      %p
        The typical animal has very few Abilities; in fact, only Bestiality (V) and
        Passive Abilities are a given, while anything else depends on the animal’s
        nature. Pools are also likely to be low, with Reason practically non-existent.
        Animals usually can’t learn non-animal Secrets, although I do use the generic
        Secrets (SECRET OF SPECIALTY and whatnot) to depict important animal
        characteristics when I feel like it.
      %p
        Of course, most of the time animals are secondary characters run by the Story
        Guide, so it’s not very likely that these details would matter much. Still,
        there are some ways for player characters to access their animal side, too.

        Animals are tamed with ANIMAL KEN (I), simply enough. Most animals aren’t
        naturally tamable, though. For those that are, the player needs to choose how
        he wants to handle the animal as a game element:
      %ul.simple
        %li
          EQUIPMENT: animals might be made into equipment reasonably enough. The ANIMAL
          IMBUEMENT even allows the animal to act, sort of. The character could even
          become professional in training animals with the SECRET OF CREATION (ANIMAL
          KEN). This approach makes the animal a tool for the character; the animal won’t
          act independently nor possess individual interests.
        %li
          SIDEKICK: a tame animal, such as a horse, can be made into a sidekick with
          crunch appropriate to its nature. The character communicates with his
          sidekick with ANIMAL KEN (I) in this case, of course. A sidekick is assumed
          to not generate any drama by itself, so the Story Guide will have it get
          difficult only if abused or endangered. Note that the sidekick can’t use
          BESTIALITY (V) to support or directly aid the character; it needs to use
          TRAINING (R) for that.
        %li
          EXTRA: If the player doesn’t really care about an animal, it’s an extra and
          does not have mechanical impact on the game. It might still act as momentary
          leverage for the character, though, and be a cause for circumstance penalties
          and whatnot. An ANIMAL KEN (I) check may also be used on it easily enough to
          get an Effect or change it into equipment by declaration.
      %p
        In other words, quite straightforward once you remember that the same fictional
        thing need not have the same mechanics.

    %p
      The Imperial Age wrought many stories in Near, and brought some to wider
      knowledge, so that they would be repeated in all lands of the Empire and
      beyond. One loved by the people even after the Shadow is the romance of
      Andreth, whose songs are still sung today in the west.
    %p
      Andreth was the daughter of Arni, a great Lord of vast appetites and greater
      domains. Unusual for the time, Andreth was a trobairiz, singer of songs and
      teller of stories. Her wit pleased Arni, who would elsewise been likely to
      forbid all contact with the outside world from a daughter he was preserving for
      fine marriage.
    %p
      As a trobairiz Andreth was well-spoken and knowledgeable of all things of men,
      beasts and fair unseen. She carried herself proudly in court and dressed
      beautifully to accentuate her fair mien and lithe frame. It was justly said
      that her ways made her a fetching prize for whomever Arni would choose for her
      husband.
    %p
      Nadir at the time was a one of the Elven-kind, creatures known for their
      fickleness, immortality and fearsome magic. He was a wellknown companion to
      travelers high and low, for Nadir was always moving, never still. He was
      seeking for something, it was said, and he left many a philosopher and scholar
      in ruin when they could not satisfy his thirst for knowledge.
    %p
      Finally crossing the Wedge (a great bridge then built over two rivers it was),
      Nadir came to hear of fair Andreth of Hemmel and her wisdom. For reasons only
      known to himself Nadir then decided to match his wit against this woman.

      Arriving at Hemmel, Nadir was well received by Arni, who had grown puissant in
      the highland wars, but sought supernatural might as well. There Nadir also saw
      Andreth, who could hardly match him in fairness, but could, would and did
      answer each and every one of his questions. However, more questions were
      raised, and not only for Nadir, but for wise Andreth as well.
    %p
      After that first meeting Nadir would return to Hemmel several times. Each time
      Arni would court him in the hopes of allying himself with the fair folk; each
      time Nadir would demur, but in such a way that he would not offend the host.
      Arni, however, grew hungrier and badtempered over time.
    %p
      Andreth, on the other hand, stayed amiable yet distant to oftvisiting Nadir.
      They sparred in words and sat long into the night over old books, yet neither
      did Nadir leave her weeping with her wisdom wanting, nor did she scare him
      away.
    %p
      One time Nadir came back to Andreth with a gift of music: a harp of exquisite
      make, its strings of unbreakable steel. She looked upon it curiously before
      inquiring whether she was now to compete with the guest in song; matching
      strength against strength had been the reason of Nadir’s every visit in the
      past.
    %p
      But no, Nadir exclaimed then: it was to be a courtship present, for he had
      decided to be in love with this woman whose demeanor would not leave him even
      in the farthest reaches of Near, and of whom he now dreamed, when he had
      suffered of dreams never before.
    %p
      Nadir’s was not a fine amour, as Andreth came to learn: he would leave with no
      word and then return, sometimes against the knowledge of Arni, her father. In
      time, however, she came to expect his return and desire for their time
      together.
    %p
      What’s more, each time Nadir returned, he brought her a miraculous present.
      These gifts were of Nadir’s craft, for he was a maker of things, an Elven
      smith. Each, he said, were in equal part of him and her, through his image of
      her. Each time Andreth would return the favor to his paramour, gifting him with
      a new song; these songs, she said, were in equal part of her and him, through
      her image of him.
    %p
      In the meantime, Arni had grown still greater, becoming larger than other men.
      His patience was wearing thing even as his suspicions were fed by Andreth, who
      had become ever more distant to her tempestuous father.
    %p
      As a mighty Lord growing mightier still Arni traveled far and wide; first on
      horseback, later by his own stride, or pulled in great carriages. He was away
      often, and thus could not ascertain for himself his suspicions concerning the
      elusive Nadir.
    %p
      However, ultimately an opportunity came to him – or rather, he came to it, as
      Arni grew in determination and hired a magician to bewitch himself. Soon after,
      while traveling away from home, Arni had a dream of the elf on the escarpments
      of castle Hemmel. Fortified with his dream visitation, Arni knew to return
      home.
    %p
      Surprising the two lovers at his castle made Arni furious, but also satisfied,
      as now he knew that he could always trust his instincts in the matters of men
      and the Elven kind. Nadir he threw into a dark oubliette, Andreth was locked
      away in a tower; Arni would think long and hard on their punishment.
    %p
      As already established, Arni’s temper was awakened by the imagined slight to
      his honor. His rage doubled when he discovered the treasures of Nadir, and
      tripled when he discovered the songs written by his daughter; beautiful new
      things in the world, but not made for him.
    %p
      Finally, unable to come to decision, Arni made one anyway: he had the elf
      brought forward and told Nadir that he would deface and slay Andreth himself
      should the elf seek escape by his arts. Then he had Andreth brought forward and
      gave the two a cunning choice: one would have to die to calm the giant’s
      temper, but the choice would have to be in their hands. In this way Arni bound
      Nadir’s Elven magic to his own purposes.
    %p
      They say that later on Andreth and Nadir would live together in humility. To
      this day their progeny, considered Half-Elven, lives among men. They are much
      loved for their cunning craft and courteous manner, and the songs Andreth
      taught everybody to sing.
    %p
      More important still for many is the seeking of treasures: men in Maldor swear
      up and down that they’ve seen the magical harp, the mask and other things made
      by Nadir, still glowing bright golden, still with wondrous powers, proof of his
      love for Andreth.

        Typical Pool CONDITIONING for Oranides involves getting lost on the plains,

        Typical Ability ENHANCEMENTS for Oranides originate in classical training

        Typical EQUIPMENT for Oranides depends: tribesmen have bows, initiation
        regalia, horses, spears, staffs, herds, hero bands, musical instruments, bark
        writing. Tribeswomen have farming tools, pottery, initiation regalia,
        storehouses, homes, drainage systems, covens, musical instruments, scrolls.

      Far to the north of Maldor the ancient, west of the untamed Qek lie the plains
      of Oran. Bound by mountain chains twice and edged by the Sea of Teeth, the
      plains open up in slowly rolling grasslands that range from the southern
      deserts through the trackless steppe to the lush savannah of the northern
      reaches.
    %p
      The plains of Oran are the home to an indigenous culture of horse nomads,
      stargazers and falcon-wielders, people whose sparse transhumance belies their
      love of the sky. Amidst this Spartan existence lies Kalderon, the great urban
      hub of the Skironite lands, the last colony of ancient Maldor. The civilized
      and primitive are tangled in an impossible relationship on the plains.
    %p
      Orania is an isolated land that has little to do with the rest of Near. Few
      foreign ships dock on the Boulder River banks today. Their overland trade with
      the Gorenite highlands sustains a fascinating hybrid culture that turns inward,
      content with its relative geographical isolation. Once there were two peoples
      here, now nobody knows if the Kalderonite can be separated from the Skironite.

      %p
        The Oran of today is dominated by the great city-state of Kalderon, a great hub
        that attracts the tribes from its farthest reaches. Even the primitives from
        Qek and Khale come to see Kalderon the Great with its walls the like of which
        are all but unknown in the northern Near of today.
      %p
        The myth of General Kalder and the birth of the city is a matter of great
        national pride to the citizens even as the city itself grows dry and vacant
        with the lack of trade. The patrons and free men of the city live among the
        signs of the past, carrying a great awareness of their Maldorian heritage. In
        many ways they consider themselves more of the Empire than the far Maldor
        itself and its feudal, lawless present.
      %p
        The continuing existence of Kalderon after the Time of Shadow is predicated on
        the support and cooperation of the barbarian tribes of the waste. This is the
        wisdom of Kalder, the mythic founder of the colony: Maldor would win this land
        not with force of arms, but by proving itself to the tribes. The Skyfire cast
        the original vision aside, but Kalder is still credited with the survival of
        the colony where others perished: the natives proved just as instrumental to
        the survival of the colony as the colony became to the survival of the tribes.

          It’s not a bad idea to assume that they have essentially similar crunch, except
          for the feudal social material Maldor proper has developed. For example,

              Kalderon is one of the last societies in Near to be truly ruled by a civil law
              that is punctually followed in drawing the line between right and wrong. This
              Ability is useful in knowing the old imperial laws and applying them to cases,

            %dd
              “The art of living with others” is a cornerstone of Oranide life. The
              magistrates of Kalderon put great stock to understanding their friends and
              enemies, and inventing means of avoiding needless strife. Life is difficult

            %dt Secret of the Senator

              The character has been voted into the Kalderonite Senate, which enables him to
              use SPEAK (R), DIPLOMACY (R) and other appropriate Abilities to control the
              arms and treasury of the state. As long as he remains human, each scene during
              which he makes an Ability check to participate in the Senate he has to check
              RESIST (R) against his own check; failure compels him to lose a piece of human
              crunch (regaining Advances) or gain a piece of crunch from another species
              appropriate to the character (going into Advance debt if necessary). The gained
              crunch has to be the mandatory Secret of the species (changing the character’s
              species permanently) if he already has more Advances invested into the species
              than his RESIST (R) check’s value.

              The character is an officer of the Kalderonite civil service. The powers of his
              office are termed in a senatorial degree, which is created by a LAW (R) check
              made into an Effect that describes the office and is maintained however long
              the magister needs those powers. The character can draw bonus dice equal to a
              suitable office’s value to issues of authority, but not against a higher-valued
              applicable office. He can only be prosecuted for his actions in office by
              stripping the office from him, which requires overcoming the Effect. In fact,
              casting the office in doubt would probably be necessary to get a Kalderonite to
              even manhandle the magister, such is their respect for the civil service and
              the laws protecting it. Career civil servants often hold multiple offices
              simultaneously, shedding and obtaining them freely; the player decides when to
              allow the Effects to lapse and when to seek new ones.

              details of the item are established in half by the player and the Story Guide.
              Characters can also sell equipment: the character regains the Advance and gains
              a free Effect equal to equipment quality in trade. Citizen Cost: 2 REASON if

      %p
        Kalderon is ruled by a senate of elders, which votes for its own replenishment
        (only citizens are eligible) and imbues magisters to deal with individual
        matters. The power of the senate is reined in by popular assembly, which may
        convene at will and set binding decrees for the senate. The senators themselves
        are lofty figures rarely seen in broad daylight, a custom which developed
        during the Shadow. As the story would have it, the senate consists almost
        exclusively of elves, which are adored and feted by the city at large. In truth
        a majority starts on their way to goblinhood as soon as they are elected.
      %p
        The modern Kalderon exists in a precarious balance between the tribes,
        displaying the majesty of old Maldor and sharing freely of the literary
        heritage in the hopes of pacifying the tribes and affirming its alliances time
        and again. The Legion of Kalderon is a superior fighting force, but it pales in
        numbers to the hordes that ride the plains.
      %p
        Recently the Ammeni houses have opened trade enclaves in Kalderon to sell
        slaves and buy metals. The heirs of old Maldor have their differences, and the
        patricians of the city are undecided; the City has been isolationist in nature
        ever since the Darkness receded, satisfying itself with unifying Orania into
        something resembling a nation. Should this change, nobody knows how far the
        untested navy and oldfashioned Legion could cast their shadow.

        The tribes of Oran, although split into a multitude, share a distinct heritage,
        lifestyle and beliefs. Although the tribes are many and self-governing, they
        mostly live in peace – a tribal chief is more likely to bring his grievance to
        Kalderon, and another more likely to heed the magistrates, than either would be
        to flout the reverence the Horse Lords hold for the Sons of Kalder.
      %p
        The greatest rift between the tribes concerns, not surprisingly, Kalderon
        itself. There are those who still hold the memory of the land before the Empire
        came, and even if the Empire has long gone, Kalderon yet remains. Tribes that
        detest the influence of the newcomers in the timeless life of the plains have
        long migrated to the far inland reaches of Oran, away from the coast and easy
        reach of the legion of Kalder. While these Traditional tribes are able to know
        peace, they do not obey the laws of Kalder: caravans from Goren are attacked,
        herds taken by the strong from the weak and so on.
      %p
        What nearly all the tribes share is the way of life they call PURDA, the
        segregation. Scholars of Kalder speculate that purda originates with the Time
        of Darkness when the tribes secluded themselves in communal cave shelters,
        shelters in which they lived segregated by gender, only finally coming out to
        breed during the tail-end of the Darkness. The eunuchs claim that purda has
        always been with the tribes, making them what they are.
      %p
        What the purda means is no more or less than a full separation of the spheres
        of male and female life. The males of the tribes are nomads, warriors and Horse
        Lords, ruling the plains, while the tribe’s women and children live in villages
        or towns founded in the more fertile parts of the plains, such as at large
        cienega or river valleys. All other things are divided accordingly: herd
        animals are male issue, plants female; trade male, storage female; bright
        colors male, earth hues female; wind instruments male, stringed ones female and

            night. Knowing the stories and lore of the constellations is today a Crop Woman
            task, while men use these skills to orient themselves on the dark plains at
            night.

          %dd
            The Skironite Crop Women can read the sky for signs. The most important purpose
            for this is in predicting the weather, but other things might be seen as well:
            the Ability may replace PRAY (V) in SECRET OF PROPHECY.
          %dt Female Rites (R)
          %dd
            Skironite women give birth when the men are away, in rites that are severely
            restricted from male knowledge. The Ability is useful for knowing about
            reproduction, midwifery, contraception, abortion and treating women’s and
            children’s diseases.
          %dt Secret of Initiation
          %dd
            The character can initiate others to the various Blessings known to the tribes.
            This always requires set numbers of worshippers, testing of the initiates, a
            minimum number of initiates, some of which are left out, drawing lots, several
            tribes, specific genders, specific politics (Kalderonite or Traditionalist) and
            other such constraints. In the fiction these demands depend on the specific
            theological history of the blessing, but for our purposes the player gets to
            concoct whatever demands he wants, backing them with a PRAY (V) check. Another
            priest can override with his own offer only by beating the prior check with his
            own or by waiting until the next season. The actual initiation ritual is
            conducted with MUSIC (I). Cost: 1 REASON to establish the ritual, 2 to conduct
            it.
          %dt Weather Blessing
          %dd
            The character can control the weather with an appropriate Ability check:
            STARGAZING (R) at night, CLOUD-READING (R) at day. Larger weather events can
            take several days to arrive. The check result may be used as bonus or penalty
            dice in Ability checks as appropriate. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Blue Light Blessing
          %dd
            The character masters the blue light, a fearsome Skironite combat magic. It
            gathers around him when he threshes his weapons, becoming especially potent
            when he jumps or otherwise gets off the ground. An enemy struck by the force
            suffers AGGRAVATED Harm, marked as such. Release the force at an enemy from
            afar with ARCHERY (I) or up close with WRESTLING (V). The force is completely
            drained when the character goes prone. Cost: 2 VIGOR
          %dt Blessing of Kalder
          %dd
            This is the same as the BLESSING OF LOWDEN JUDGE, except use LAW (R) when
            nobody is lying and REACT (I) when somebody is. Cost: 2 VIGOR THE
          %dt Hippogriff Blessing
          %dd
            A hippogriff from the mountains is attracted by the character. It is commanded
            with FALCONRY (I) and ridden with HORSEMANSHIP (I). Keeping the hippogriff in
            service for longer than you need it makes it sad; release it, and it will
            return to you. Cost: 2 VIGOR Requirements: a prior initiation to another
            Blessing.
          %dt Blessing of the Moon
          %dd
            The character can change his sex, becoming a member of the other gender. This
            may only be attempted when the Moon is full; use BRAWLING (V) to change into a
            man, FEMALE RITES (R) to change into a woman. Cost: 2 VIGOR Requirements: a
            prior initiation to another Blessing.

            Most Oranides come to possess this Key in their adulthood, as they come to
            accept their way of life. 1xp: The other gender is not present. 2xp: Avoid
            interacting with things pertaining to the other gender. 5xp: Interact with the

      %p
        The purda is regulated by the annual transhumance, falling on different days in
        different parts of the plains. In the most traditionalist tribes the genders
        meet only twice a year: once in the fall for the culling of herds and courtship
        of the most accomplished males, once in the spring for a general revelry and
        initiation of boys into men. Even the most radical tribesmen would blush at the
        thought of coming uninvited to a women’s town outside the allotted times.
      %p
        Summer is a time of farming for the women, while men go out and take the herds
        to the distant parts of the plains, to the highlands and other inhospitable
        places. Therein the men make war on Violators and trolls, competing for the
        right of courtship in fall. The herds winter in the low country, nearer to the
        town, wherein the women spend the off-season working on crafts. Some tribes
        break purda in between the fall and spring celebrations, but most don’t.
      %p
        Sexually the Oranides are alien to most of Near: while the romantic culture,
        stories and songs of both sexes celebrates heterosexual pairing, everyday
        practice among the herdsmen and in the towns tends towards casually homosexual.
        Familial relationships in most tribes are fleeting at best; responsibility
        between genders is communal, not personal, and there is no stigma if a man
        chooses to court a different woman in a different year. Tribesmen traveling to
        other lands often find them prude and shameless at the same time.
      %p
        A distinctive part of the purda are the EUNUCHS, men riven of their genitalia
        and allowed to conduct trade and other coordination between the male and female
        communities. Another grey area in the dualism of purda are transsexuals: when
        children are initiated as adults, they are in principle free to choose an
        initiation into either gender. Such manwomen and woman-men are considered
        members of their adopted gender in all ways, sexual mores included. Even adults
        can change sex later in life, at least if they’re willing to undergo the rites
        again, including the ritual castration that man-women undergo.
      %p
        The purda separates Oranides from other peoples on a fundamental level. Even
        towards their allies in Kalderon it is the great unspoken issue: as little as
        the Kalderonites are willing to execute purda on their own are the tribesmen
        willing to let go of their tradition. All tribes, excepting the most
        traditional, have come to accept that other people have different ways:
        foreigners are usually classified and dealt with as children, free of the purda
        as they know not better.

        Aside from the laws of segregation, a central identity element for the tribes
        of Oran is their shared reverence of the Sky as a divine element. It is said
        that the great mountains are seen everywhere in Oran, and the birds that fly
        the endless sky are more numerous than the stars of old. Even as the stars have
        dimmed there isn’t a village without a Stargazer, or a herd without a
        Falconier. Unlike the Purda, this is a tradition that has been embraced whole
        by Kalderon: the tribal divinities have become the most popular of the cults in
        the secular city, and the tribal knowledge of the sky has been combined with
        Kalderonite astrology.
      %p
        Unlike all other elements of life, the reverence for the sky crosses the purda,
        perhaps because the sky rites are such a large aspect of the biannual
        celebrations. Crop Women call to the sky for rains or warmth while Horse Lords
        sing of destiny; both use the same tunes. This sky ritual magic is called
        BLESSINGS; they are like normal Secrets, except gaining them can be a bit
        arduous. Blessings are gained among the Skironites in various communal rites,
        the most powerful and oldest of which require the participation of both
        genders, if not multiple prior initiations for the initiate; only the most able
        should be eligible, but in Kalderonite tribes it is often the most influential
        who are initiated.
      %p
        A central tenet of the Oranide religion concerns the coming of the mythical
        beast, HIPPOGRIFF; it is believed that this cross-breed of eagle and horse
        comes from its mountain lair at the call of the true song of the Horse Lord.
        Flying is considered a holy act by the Oranides, flying with the winged horse
        doubly so. The greatest heroes are supposed to fly over the Roof, to land in
        the Great Steppe beyond, the ancestral homeland of all Oranides.

        I’ve never played! When I last was in Kalderon, I didn’t have all this stuff to
        play with. Like, for instance, Purda – nothing even close to that, we just had
        lots of classical statuary the nomads had a tendency for breaking. And insofar
        as I know, others have not had the full majesty of Kalderon to tool around with
        either, so we’re breaking completely new ground here.

        Kalderon is like Constantinople, a great remainder of a greater culture. I
        really adore it out there on the western edge of the Sea of Teeth with my
        settingdesign senses; the northern Near is so sparse of culture without it, and
        the Ammeni need a counterbalance of some sort in the area to get a good sea
        battle going. This way there’s some place where the Qek and Khaleans and such
        can meet in a tavern without the tavern being in the middle of a jungle
        somewhere.
      %p
        The political process of Kalderon is complex, dehumanizing and essentially
        modern. This does not mean that it is necessarily evil: not only can a
        politician hold onto his morality by being willing to curtail his inculcation
        into the system, but even were he to turn into another politician, that implies
        nothing about the nobility of his goals.
      %p
        A Skironite character, on the other hand, faces two obvious questions: his
        relationship to Kalderon, whose gates are never closed, and his relationship to
        the Purda. The questions are related, but not entirely.
      %p
        Winning Blessings is a necessary step in becoming a Skironite hero, but that
        might require accomplishments or political influence itself, depending on the
        nature of the given tribe’s priests. The similarities with Kalderonite politics
        are not incidental.

      %p
        The Vadenite archipelago was colonized by the Empire early due to its important
        position as a supply base and military installation in the southwestern waters
        of Near. With time the installations on the island were enlarged; both the
        Hamodine wars and ocean exploration efforts initiated by the celestial
        bureaucracy warranted substantial improvements to the naval capacities of the
        Inselburg fortress, making it the largest operative nexus of imperial naval
        activities.
      %p
        At the time of the Skyfire, however, Inselburg had already been a decade into a
        rebellion against the Empire. The original reasons for the rebellion are
        largely forgotten outside the islands; the islanders themselves cite a palace
        coup that closed off oceanic exploration, corruption of the imperial
        bureaucracy, and their unquenched thirst for freedom. The reasons for the
        original betrayal of the naval command, which made the rebellion possible,
        remain a mystery and a popular topic of stories.
      %p
        When the Skyfire appeared and the world trembled at the omen, the Vadian
        islanders interpreted the growing glow favorably for their hard-pressed, waning
        rebellion. The attitude is held to this day: anything lesser than the Skyfire
        could not have destroyed Absolon’s Empire, they say.

            The character knows how to create COLLEGIUMS by investing holy vows that bind.
            The vows are created by one or more PRAY (V) checks made into Effects which
            determine the power of the vows and the consequences for breaking them. The
            collegium is created by choosing a Secret the character knows, renaming it
            appropriately, perhaps changing some Abilities it requires and reducing its
            Pool cost by one point per vow connected to it. (The vows can also provide
            bonus or penalty dice as appropriate to Secrets that do not have a Pool cost.)
            The magister can now teach the new Secret to his collegiates without caring for
            any requirements the Secret used to have. The magister can have the collegial
            magic strike anybody who knows the Secret with the power of the Effect to cause
            the consequences indicated by the vows to befell him, but only once per Effect
            per target. The target may RESIST (R) the magic. This does not expend the
            collegial Effect; it (and the discount on the Secret) remains as long as the

            an incoming magic’s power through the staff into the earth, the sea or into
            another person, depending on where the eclectic roots his staff. Success levels
            equal to the eclectic’s check are diverted from the opposing magician’s check
            before it reaches its target. This trick suffers a circumstance penalty die

          %dd
            The character has been taught how to sail the black ships, and he is thus
            capable of using his appropriate Abilities for the purpose. The ships and their
            equipment are a technological aberration at present time, so operating them
            ranges from difficult to impossible without in-depth tutelage in various
            applied sciences. Characters with this training may consider any High Seas
            Fleet equipment to have an appropriate EXPERT IMBUEMENT for free.
          %dt Demolition (R)
          %dd
            Fleet crews in Inselburg are trained to handle the black ship cannons and other
            explosives; specialist marines are trained as grenadiers as well.
          %dt Explosive Imbuement
          %dd
            This single-use imbuement can be used with a DEMOLITION (R) check. One
            equipment rating in the equipment gains a +2 to its value for this roll;
            however, if the check is opposed, the character suffers an additional Harm
            equal to the check difference (towards his actual check, not the equipment
            rating). The imbuement is removed after use.
          %dt Black Sail Imbuement
          %dd
            The black ship sails are superior to modern solutions, being usually the only
            propulsion such a ship uses. The ship with this rigging can compete or overcome
            galley arrangements in most winds, especially when it has room to maneuver. It
            has SUPERIOR LEVERAGE against galleys on open sea when it comes to maneuvers or
            long journeys; the black ship chooses whether to engage and how in those
            conditions.
          %dt Black Hull Imbuement
          %dd
            The larger black ships are much taller than most modern ones, except perhaps
            for the giant galleys of Ammeni. This is not entirely beneficial in shallow
            waters, but in close engagement it makes boarding action impossible for an
            unprepared enemy. The ship may also have an unlimited number of other
            imbuements thanks to its size.
          %dt Cannon Imbuement
          %dd
            The black ship has cannons. There is very little that lesser ships can do
            against them at range: when the cannons are used with DEMOLITION (R) (or
            COMMAND (I) if directing fire for a battery), normal Ability checks cannot be
            used to resist them at all. An opposing ship or coastal target needs magic or
            other equivalent leverage to defend or counterattack meaningfully, otherwise a
            simple check suffices for the cannons. Cost: 1 Vigor per shot

        The Year of Shadow was not as hard on Inselburg as it was on many other
        peoples, thanks to the thick walls of the fortress and the war-time discipline
        already in place. When the Shadow receded, what had been a minor rebellion was
        now a self-sufficient, isolated nation.
      %p
        The modern Inselburg is a poor nation scattered on a hundred islands and a
        thousand islets in the Vadenite archipelago. The people dress modestly in thick
        black felts that protect them against the cold winter storms of the southern
        sea. A free man is expected to own his own boat, so as to be able to join in
        the fishing. Others have to know useful trades or hire on as boathands.
      %p
        The islands were incredibly poor after the Shadow, all but the largest being
        scoured clean by the cataclysm. Inselburg itself cannot hold the steadily
        climbing population, however, so the most adventurous families moved early to
        stake claim to the best islands. Typically a family would be careful to remain
        in contact with the fortress residents through close familial relationships
        with those remaining inside.
      %p
        Today Inselburg is a convoluted decentralized democracy stretching several days
        of good sailing from the fortress proper. The individual islands are
        self-governing: originally this was because a single family would live on one
        island, later because no agreement on common government could be established.
        Each island sends a representative to the annual Congress at Inselburg; the
        most important decisions concern voting for Prefects who maintain the fortress,
        allocating desirable living space inside Inselburg proper and deciding on the
        deployment and captaincies of the High Seas Fleet.
      %p
        Trade and socializing have the archipelago bustling with activity through the
        summer. Disagreements are common as well, but trouble is handled very
        courteously; ostracism of community is a threat, and the elected Prefects of
        the fortress can bar entrance to trouble-makers at will. As honorable marriages
        and other celebrations are held exclusively at the fortress, being barred from
        entering is a heavy threat to honorable islanders.
      %p
        Still, what most holds the people of Inselburg together and on the islands may
        not be mutual love and fascination with the sparse livelihood: the heritage of
        the rebellion weights heavily on their conscience, and as long as the High Seas
        Fleet remains, it defines the nation as surely as any ruler.

        Inselburg proper arches over five closely-spaced islets. In between the cliffs
        lie dark entrances into the bowels of the stone fortress, entrances usable by
        the largest of ships. In these cave harbors the imperial High Seas Fleet
        wintered, safe from the savage southern winter storms. And there they yet
        remain, those that have not succumbed to age.
      %p
        The ships of the line are large, technologically superior to anything modern
        Near knows. They have multiple masts and complex rigging, and no oars, for they
        are far too large to move about with mere muscle. The ships are too tall to
        board from all but the largest galleys, and what must be the most frightening,
        they have slots for cannons that belch smoke, fire and lead.
      %p
        The ships of the High Seas Fleet are black from tar-based paints they are
        treated with to prevent aging of the wood. The Black Ships, as they are known
        to outsiders, are a matter of great fear and superstition on the Ocean. The
        only major engagement of the fleet a few years ago resulted in a crushing
        defeat for the first son of an Ammeni house; only two ships of the fleet were
        mobilized then, and both returned without losses.
      %p
        What the High Seas Fleet has done to Inselburg cannot be underestimated: the
        solid fishermen and traders of the islands do not know what to do with what
        they have, but they are utterly committed to preserving the legacy their
        forebears fought for. Every family sends a son to learn the sailing skills
        required to crew a black ship; every woman of the islands knows how to weave
        the thick sails used in the salty ocean breezes.  Regardless, a certain awe and
        superstition surrounds the ships on the otherwise indigent islands.
      %p
        A major reason for the Inselburg Congress, and a primary responsibility for the
        Prefects, is the safeguarding of the High Seas Fleet from sabotage, larceny and
        coup d’état. A congress action is required to crew and send out the ships,
        except for two that are kept in permanent readiness by the Prefects. So
        reluctant are the islanders to risk or misuse the Fleet that they actually
        organize a merchant flotilla out of lesser boats and newly built ships to
        reduce the usage of the Fleet. Even knowledge of where the black ships come
        from is not easy to come by in most parts of Near.

        The islanders are socially very conformist and proper, to such a degree that it
        is not unknown for a family to oust members who bring shame to them. The only
        exception to this comes in the activity of so called COLLEGIUMS, cults and
        guilds islanders support. Absolute freedom of thought is prized in Inselburg,
        perhaps as a compensation for the arid and routine life they have to endure.
        While people are expected to follow the social code in public, in private they
        can do almost anything they like without censure; rather, anybody trying to
        blackmail another for their private choices would surely be shunned themselves.
      %p
        While some of the collegiums are professional in nature, most are essentially
        mystery cults: prospective members joining a collegium (which often happens at
        various festivals at the fortress) are promised hidden lore and various
        concrete benefits for joining the collegium. Collegiums do not necessarily
        require much of their members, but revealing their secrets to outsiders is a
        major offense punished by cult magics, more or less effectual.
      %p
        Membership in a collegium is exclusive unless the collegium MAGISTER gives
        permission for multiple initiation. Holding a magisterium is considered a
        public office due some respect, as many of the collegiums are important for the
        everyday life of the islands. For example, the Star Captain Brotherhood has
        cult magic of such importance to navigation that membership is considered
        practically mandatory for anybody wishing to captain a ship of the High Seas
        Fleet.
      %p
        One of the most unfortunate crimes in Inselburg is the breaking of collegial
        vows an initiate takes when entering the collegium. A legendary stormcrow
        figure in Inselburgian lore is the collegial ECLECTIC, a magician who steals
        collegial secrets and avoids the retributive curses with magics of his own.
        While breaking collegial vows is not a civil crime in Inselburg, the eclectic
        is shunned: his magic turns the retribution directed against him towards
        others, causing storms, poisoning of the earth and worse for those associating
        with him.

        Greek city-state, Protestant Germans and Switzerland.
      %p
        The real mileage I get from Inselburg is as a sort of world police. The Black
        Ships can show up almost everywhere, and the Inselburgians are considerably
        decent compared to many larger nations in Near. When it seems that a player
        character has burned all his bridges in the focal point of the campaign, a
        Black Ship might be the ticket to a new life if he’s willing to cooperate at
        all. The beauty if it is, of course, that the Inselburgians are also pretty
        impotent when you get over those cannons.
      %p
        If Maldor and Ammeni (and some parts of Old Goren) are considered comparatively
        civilized next to the various barbarian cultures of Near, then Inselburg can be
        counted in that group as well. It is, however, a different sort of animal in
        this era of warlords and empires.

        the whole country.

        The political system of the fortress is in reality a secret, unacknowledged
        battleground for the various collegiums and their magisters, some of which

      Most ships sailing the seas of Near hail from Ammeni or Inselburg, or perhaps
      Maldor. Fearsome pirates hail from Khale and Jošland, but none are more feared
      and mysterious than the Feyan rebel ships slashing at the coasts of Maldor and
      Ammeni. They are rarely witnessed, even more seldom warded against and always
      lost to the mists of the high seas when pursued.
    %p
      Few know where the islands of Pere-di-Fey are, for they follow the tides. Among
      the vagabonds of old Maldor flow a hundred stories of the blessed archipelago
      and its miracles. The common saying has it that neither the rich nor the
      powerful are welcome on the isles, which come only to those of humility and
      soft heart. Escaped plantation slaves of Ammeni, homeless peons from Maldor and
      even refugees from Tiserian purges of the far west seek their way towards the
      eastern coastline and the places where the islands are told to appear when the
      moon is full or when the sun sets in the midsummer’s eve. For many this hope of
      Pere-di-Fey is their last, best hope.
    %p
      The truth of the matter is somewhat more disappointing. The barren islands are
      sorely overpopulated by the burgeoning crowds of escapees, whose hospitality is
      being strained by every new arrival. Life on the moving islands is not an easy
      one even for the natives, and with fresh bitterness flooding the islands every
      time they happen close to the shore, there is ample support for the most cruel
      piracy, looting and murder of the continental masters.

        The isles of Pere-di-Fey range from large, forested main isles to smaller
        islets and flat rocks jutting out from the sea. In the times before the Shadow
        the islands were far in the Eastern Ocean, so far so that ships from Near or
        the Hamouadi Empire only seldom visited the archipelago. People called Kairakau
        had always inhabited the islands, but few cared about them. Most important
        trade article of the isles were the colorful, varied crustaceans and coral
        growths harvested by the people.
      %p
        When the Skyfire came, the Feyan islands shook. When its baleful light grew,
        Kairakau grew worried. Some started having dreams, many left as prophets spoke
        of destruction that would wash over the islands. The prophets remained,
        however, convinced that they would be spared.
      %p
        When the Skyfire disappeared and the land shook, great waves washed over the
        coasts of Near. Pere-di-Fey in the deep ocean fared better than most places,
        but when the sun dimmed and winked out, the few people left were sure to
        perish.
      %p
        However, all was not lost: Kairakau prophets, now called LAND-SPEAKERS, spoke
        to the islands themselves and had them open for the people so they could
        shelter themselves inside.  Hundreds wintered in the moist recesses of the
        Feyan isles through the Shadow, guided by the land-speakers. Most of the
        islands sank to the bottom of the Ocean to wait out the Shadow.
      %p
        After the Moon rose, nothing was the same for the Feyans. The islands
        themselves had awakened, and were now on the move. The large islands drifted
        slowly, almost imperceptibly. The smaller islets would frolic in moonlight,
        raising foam, but keeping close to the larger ones. Some, unmoving, were left
        behind, like dead carcasses of mighty beasts.
      %p
        Through the years the archipelago has zigzagged over the Ocean, ranging from
        the subtropics to the frigid reaches. Where the islands once slept now blows
        the Torrid Clime, and they show no signs of returning. To the contrary, the
        general direction of the migration has over the generations been towards the
        southeast, towards Near; today individual isles may sometimes be seen from the
        continent, and the greater ones get closer every year. Only in the Southern Sea
        and the Sea of Teeth are the islands never sighted.

            can’t be a culture another player character is from, unless the other player
            accedes to it. In addition, the character always regains one extra Pool point

            to take a superstition seriously for the moment, the player can create an
            Effect out of a REACT (I) check to make note of it. The Effect can later be
            used as either bonus or penalty dice according to the superstition, even

            Shellstone is a very, very hard mineral mined sometimes on the Feyan islands

            Whatever it is, the Talalag holds a point of ICHOR, which can be spent as a

        The Kairakau were few after the Shadow, but their numbers started climbing
        quickly once the landspeakers figured out how the islands could be compelled to
        make a beeline towards Near, a direction they were keen to take anyway. The
        islanders needed materials and knowledge if they were to make their bare-blown
        home habitable once again; they were willing to provide homes to those who
        would bring these things with them.
      %p
        Kairakau had always valued hospitality as a virtue above others, so they were
        only too happy to take in wretched refugees from the wars and calamity of the
        slowly shattering continental empire. The first legends of Pere-di-Fey date
        from the first generation after the Shadow. After the Feyans, now a mixed stock
        of natives and mixed refugees of a dozen nations, gained a few ships of their
        own, they could keep in regular contact with the continental world regardless
        of where their island homes went.
      %p
        Today the islands are densely inhabited by the discarded wretches of all the
        nations of Near. Many fish, some farm, some practice crafts, but most stay on
        their ships and engage in everything from trade to piracy to sustain
        themselves. The islands provide a point of contact for the crews, an
        opportunity to repair ships and trade for necessities. There are even towns on
        the larger, semi-stabile islands far out on the Ocean.
      %p
        The Feyans have an adventurous and romantic reputation in many parts of Near
        due to their famed hospitality and “steal from the rich, give to the poor”
        stylings. In other places they are feared and hated for the inhuman savagery of
        some pirate crews. Each crew is only responsible to their captain, and the
        captains answer to no-one, so the Feyans have dozens of faces out in the world.

      %p
        The Kairakau were taught by the land-speakers through the Year of Shadow to
        respect the islands that sheltered them, the HALATU; land-speakers believed
        them to be living creatures of a distant world. The Feyans also learned of the
        TALALAG, the crustacean creatures long used for food, jewelry and tools on the
        islands. According to the priests, the Talalag were sibling creatures to the
        islands themselves, coming in a multitude of forms and sizes, all of which
        helped the islands thrive as living biospheres. The most holy of the
        land-speakers became bonded to the islands when they took the Talalag into
        themselves, becoming a part of the true ecosystem of the islands.
      %p
        Today all religions and philosophies of Near are practiced in Pere-di-Fey, but
        the most respect is still accorded to the land-speakers and Talal-captains,
        people who willingly provide a home to small Talalag in their own bodies. These
        symbionts range in size from a finger’s width to as large as a limb. They look
        weird, colorful and exotic, ugly by continental standards, scary to sea people
        who know what they mean. Talal-hosts gain many talents from their symbiosis,
        such as a protection from drowning.
      %p
        However, they cannot leave the Ocean, as the Talalag die if they dry out
        completely. Often refugees are only accorded respect once they prove their
        commitment to the Pere-di-Fey by taking on a symbiont.

        %p
          The Talalag symbionts are like Secrets, except that they can be taken on and
          shed with a simple LANDSPEECH (I) check made by the character or an attendant.
          However, symbiosis is physically painful and straining as the symbiont learns
          to live with the character: he suffers a Harm equal to the size of the symbiont
          each time one is attached or removed.
        %p
          The symbiont’s SIZE is a simple free Effect attached to the symbiont Secret.
          The Story Guide may assume that most symbionts are in the 1–2 range, unless the
          character makes a point of looking for a particularly large Talalag of the
          appropriate type. A larger size makes for a more powerful symbiont, but it’s
          also more distinctive and straining, and more dangerous when it is removed. The
          group might well assume that the character’s Harm track sets a practical
          maximum for his number of symbionts; having more and larger symbionts than he
          can absorb the Harm from would mean that there’s more Talalag than human in the
          symbiosis, and the character would die were he ever forcibly separated from his
          symbionts.
        %p
          The Talalag are powered by the character’s Pools, but most of them cannot
          sustain themselves directly: instead, they feed on ICHOR POOLS. The simplest
          symbionts help the character transform his Pools into ichor, which is stored by
          the symbiont. The player can track the ichor Pools just like he does with the
          character’s own Pools, and transform one into the other at his convenience.
        %p
          There are four different ichors in the Talalag ecology: the RED and YELLOW are
          the most common; they might be understood as roughly analogical to the
          difference between vegetative and animal life, were a character to examine the
          ecology of the isles from that viewpoint. BLACK and GREEN are more rare and
          specialized, at least in Pere-di-Fey. I use three types of symbionts: the base
          ones that provide ichors, simple ones that spend one type and big ones that
          require a continuous supply of one type and some of another.
        %p
          The various powers characters gain from symbionts are used in conflict with
          appropriate Ability checks. Typically this would be LAND- SPEECH (R) when the
          issue is understanding Talalag and USE SYMBIONT (V) when it’s an issue of being
          used to the new senses or whatever the character has to deal with.
        %p
          The Talalag themselves can be depicted as animal-like characters by the Story
          Guide when appropriate; some are large enough to interact with. They’d probably
          have an ichor-based biology, Passive Abilities and so on, but using normal
          animal rules is close enough for our purposes here.

              The character has researched the Talalag and their capabilities for symbiosis;
              a successful LAND-SPEECH (I) check can be used to recognize different Talalags
              and their needs as symbionts; the character can find any size of symbiont up to
              his check result by trawling the islands. A check can also be used when the
              symbiosis is commenced or ended to guide the Talalag and reduce the Harm it
              causes by the check result. Cost: 1 INSTINCT to reduce Harm.

              The character can breathe water. He can also transform VIGOR into any color of
              ICHOR. The symbiont stores a maximum of its size in ichor at once, and can
              store multiple colors. The symbiont dies if the character doesn’t submerge in
              the ocean every day. Cost: 1 VIGOR plus the number to transform into one color

              of its size in ichor at once, and can store either color. The symbiont dies if
              the character doesn’t submerge in the ocean every day. Cost: 1 INSTINCT plus

              YELLOW ICHOR. The symbiont stores a maximum of its size in ichor at once, and
              can store either color. The symbiont dies if the character doesn’t submerge in

            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like a series of pearl insets on the character’s
              skin. It allows him to track his absolute location like a bird, and to
              communicate with other neural symbionts over distance; I simply use a radio
              wave analogy in figuring out the details, so the communication can be listened
              by outsiders, it gets messed up by storms and so on. The symbiont can only
              handle its size in ichor per scene. Cost: 1 YELLOW ICHOR for location, 1 for
              each communication target.
            %dt Engram Symbiont
            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like subcutaneous inserts in the character’s head
              and neck. It provides him with perfect memory over the period it’s been with
              him, instant recall and considerable additional thinking speed. The character
              can replace any REASON-based Ability check result with the size value of the
              symbiont. The symbiont goes inert without a steady supply of YELLOW ICHOR,
              dying soon after. Cost: 1 YELLOW ICHOR per scene. BLACK ICHOR equal to half the
              difference (round down) between the replaced result and symbiont size.
            %dt Regenerative Symbiont
            %dd
              This symbiont usually looks like coral growth in the character’s scars. It
              allows him to ignore any physical Harm up to the size of the symbiont, as it
              quickly grows alternate matter to compensate for the wound. The symbiont goes
              inert without a steady supply of RED ICHOR, dying soon after. Cost: 1 RED ICHOR
              per scene. 2 GREEN ICHOR to ignore a Harm.

            %dd
              The character has so many symbionts that he is being influenced by the Halatu.
              He can refresh his Ichor Pools by immersing in the ocean and having an episode
              where the Talalag influence overwhelms him, for good or ill. The player can
              make a LAND-SPEECH (I) check to narrate the received visions, revelations and
              actions the character does during the refreshment himself; if the check fails
              or the player doesn’t have a particularly swinging idea of where to take the
              mysterious creatures, the Story Guide gets to narrate. Cost: 1 INSTINCT
              Requirement: the character has more symbiont size levels than Pool levels.
            %dt Secret of Growth
            %dd
              The character has learned to control his symbiont ecosystem somewhat. A
              successful LAND-SPEECH (I) check allows him to either raise or lower the size
              of a single symbiont by a step. The process takes a day or so. Cost: 3 minus
              the check result in INSTINCT.
            %dt Secret of Isle Speak
            %dd
              The character has learned to guide the Pere-di-Fey islands, and can direct them
              in the ocean. Establish a relationship with an island as a LAND-SPEECH (I)
              Effect. The player can pick any size of island, but the larger ones are very
              slow, and only the character with the best relationship towards a given island
              is actually heeded. Any relationship is considered one level weaker when the
              character wants to turn the island towards the north, and one level stronger
              when going towards the south, especially south-west. Cost: 3 INSTINCT to turn
              an island, or 1 YELLOW ICHOR with the NEURAL SYMBIONT.
            %dt Secret of Isle Fog
            %dd
              The Pere-di-Fey isles can billow out large clouds of thick, moist fog; they do
              this now and then anyway, but the character has learned how to make them do it
              on command. The character needs to have an active relationship to an island to
              try this. The fog from the smaller islands doesn’t get up to much, but the
              larger ones can hide the whole central archipelago from view. Cost: 3 INSTINCT

      %p
        The social structure of Pere-di-Fey is in tumult which only increases as the
        islands approach Near. Much of the population have been or still are criminals
        of various stripes, and some do not hesitate to prey on their own, especially
        in the large towns of the main islands. Even worse, any restraint they show at
        home is shed when the pirate flag is hoisted and a crew reaches its favored
        hunting waters; it is not uncommon for a crew to gather around a past wrong,
        such as slavery in the hands of the Ammeni, which they now avenge again and
        again in the most savage manner. The rewards are ample, and Feyans do not ask
        nor care where a returning ship went or what it did out on the sea.
      %p
        Respect for elders and hospitality towards the weak is a rule on the islands,
        however, which restrains the most antisocial elements for now. Increasing
        numbers of pirates gone wild have been found drowned in unspoken circumstances,
        however, as the land-speakers struggle to hold onto old Kairakau values. Many
        captains agree and make a point of welcoming the weak even while preying on the
        strong; others plot to increase their own influence in the townships on the
        expense of the Kairakau leaders.
      %p
        As things stand, it is likely that Pere-di-Fey will soon go into decline as the
        archipelago draws closer to Near. Some ships hire new crew from the continent,
        taking in outright criminals and murderers; fewer and fewer ports are willing
        to trade with the distinctive Feyan ships, as each has felt their attacks at
        least once. The Black Fleet of Inselburg is already in war with the Feyans,
        with only the elusive nature of the islands themselves protecting the
        population from a merciless revenge upon a lawless nation by ships that do not
        fear to leave the sight of the shore.
      %p
        One person sees this all and wonders; The GOVERNOR is an influential figure in
        Pere-di-Fey, so called for how they tamed the port of Felag, the ancient
        Maldorian harbor on the Heart Island. The Governor is a highly public figure,
        treating with captains and land-speakers with impunity, taking on and shedding
        symbionts as necessary. If it were up to the Governor, Pere-di-Fey would become
        a real nation and avoid a destruction in the hands of the world. He or she
        might succeed, provided that the captains could be united and the worst of the
        crews brought to justice.

        Never played this stuff, I’m just writing it down for future use. The closest I
        got was a player character who claimed to come from these isles, but I hadn’t
        even written any crunch for them then. The idea is originally Josh’s, I just
        wrote mechanics for it and honed some fluff. Do let us know if you get around
        to using this.
      %p
        I imagine that the isles could be useful exploratory content of the sort a
        Story Guide throws up when characters just want to head over the edge of the

          I don’t know about the reader, but my own first reaction to something like the
          Talalag symbionts in roleplaying games is always that the price to pay will be
          horrible. It’s just part of the genre, scientists never get to inject alien DNA
          and find out that hey, lucky us, superpowers without consequences.
        %p
          I’m saying this because I explicitly did not do this story here. I left it
          intentionally open, and even while I could have, I didn’t put in rules for how
          gaining too many symbionts makes the character into an alien zombie. The player
          will explicitly have to welcome that option through suitable Secrets, and even
          then I’d find it pretty simplistic to just assume that the Talalag all want the
          atmosphere to burn or something. Or even that they want anything; insofar as I
          know, there is no sentience in anything the land-speakers interact with.

        I’m intrigued by the idea of Pere-di-Fey as a refugee camp. The local culture
        is essentially hospitalitybased, and they can’t get too hostile towards armed
        newcomers as a group anyway, but the isles are not infinite in resources.
        Something has to give; if nothing else, perhaps the earlier arrivals start
        refusing new people entry.
      %p
        The pirates are also interesting, especially if you need a dedicated pirate
        mythology for your campaign. The idea that pirate crews consist of the refused
        minorities of Near’s various social disturbances goes a long way towards
        justifying the piracy, at least as far as sympathy goes. The consequences will
        sooner or later fall on the isles, though.
      %p
        I included the Governor as a sort of scenario-in-action, and to suggest that
        the pirate idyll on the isles is not a stable proposition that can just go on
        and on without the social dynamics going out of whack. Or perhaps it can – our
        own history knows of societies that successfully, continuously worked for
        hundreds of years on nothing but piracy and slave trade. Perhaps the original
        Kairakau humanism will get abased just like that.

      TSoY has a relatively involved equipment rules-set, which makes ships and boats
      and such mechanically quite simple. A ship is just a piece of equipment
      (chapter VI) for its captain, unless the player decides to forgo mechanizing
      the ship entirely. When a ship has multiple interesting characters, then the
      equipment is simply handled and used by multiple characters at once, each doing
      their part for the ship. Characters co-using equipment like this can share
      costs of using imbuements they use cooperatively, too.
    %p
      Sinking a ship most often happens as the outcome of a conflict; usually the
      ship’s captain has something to say about the matter, as will other characters
      in the crew. The ship itself does not have hit points or such; it’s all a
      matter of how far the captain is willing to go to protect his ship. Considering
      the consequences of a shipwreck, he will often protect his ship to the last, if
      not surrender.
    %p
      Crew is handled mostly as extras, nameless companions to the characters with
      personal interests. A singular crew member can stand out with his interests,
      even become a sidekick for the ship or leave the ship with little effect; an
      issue that affects the whole crew, on the other hand, is quick to escalate and
      take the ship from under its captain. The Story Guide will presumably lift some
      names from the crew to lead the mutiny if it comes to that; it’s a good idea
      anyway to have a couple of named secondary characters around so the player
      character involved with the ship has somebody to talk to. Another good idea is
      to keep the ship’s commission in mind: as a rule of thumb, as long as the
      captain has the KEY OF THE COMMISSION and he does not act against it, the crew
      will probably stay reasonably loyal; deviating from what the crew as a whole
      expects of the mission will require misleading or convincing the men to go
      along regardless.

      %p
        A traditional question in roleplaying concerns the role of specialty knowledge
        in playing the game: what do the players actually need to know about topics
        they play with? My own stance, especially regarding a game like TSoY, has long
        been that prior research is always a luxury, not a necessity; whatever it is
        that players know about a specialty topic like naval matters is sufficient for
        their own purposes. Knowing a lot about ancient galleys or age of sail naval
        tactics will certainly enrich the texture of the game, but it does not affect
        the dramatic component.
      %p
        Even while matters like triremes vs. quinqueremes or “holding the wind cage” on
        your opponent are near and dear to us history buffs, I resisted the temptation
        to write these matters into the rules-text here; it’s better for the individual
        Story Guide to research and build the situations and detail for his own game.
      %p
        Still, the naval setting is pretty interesting as an adventure environment, so
        a few choice examples of consideration might prove inspiring, especially if you
        have no idea what I mean when I refer to seafaring adventure. Consider:
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Galleys
        %dd
          are independent from the wind, and can be very fast on tactical distances.
          They need daily resupplies from land (water especially), and are practically
          always beached at night. They can vary in size drastically from 50 men boats to
          150 men war galleys to crazy Ammenite floating fortresses with a thousand
          rowing men and half again as many marines. Overall they’re superior to the
          sailing ships Lords of Maldor or Princes of Ammeni can muster, at least near
          coasts and on the inland seas.
        %dt Ramming
        %dd
          is an efficient tactic for galleys to sink others or break their oars, and
          works for smaller ships against larger ones. It requires a ramming prow and
          skilled crew of rowers, however. Boarding action is easy in comparison, but
          that requires a taller ship than the enemy has, practically speaking.
        %dt Missile
        %dd
          weapons are entirely feasible for shipboard marines, although they require
          training and are not very effective on shielded enemy.
        %dt Slaves
        %dd
          can be used as rowers, but they’ll try to escape at night, and they suck at
          military-grade maneuvers. Quality navies, like that of Kalderon, use free men,
          or at least promise freedom to the slaves after the campaign.
        %dt Sails
        %dd
          are high tech in this context: they require expertise, proper cloth and
          innovation to get anything capable of going against the wind. Advantages are
          smaller crew (less need for supplies) and non-stop operation. A proper sail
          will outrun a galley every time at long distances and time frames, and it is
          capable of journeys a galley could never make.
        %dt Navigation
        %dd
          is difficult, as the stars have dimmed in most parts of Near. Going a week or
          two off the course is not unlikely as a rogue current or wind confuse the
          navigator.
        %dt Winter
        %dd
          is treacherous for seafarers, and only the Black Ships brave winter storms on
          the Southern Sea. The Sea of Teeth is usable all year long, but the tsunamis
          therein can sink even a Black Ship.
      .list.container
        %dl.docutils
          %dt Boating (I)
          %dd
            Smaller vessels that do not require a large crew are operated with this
            Ability. Such vessels are easier to procure and keep than larger ones; they
            also have benefits in stealth and coastal operations, being able to reach
            places larger ships couldn’t. Fishermen, smugglers and such would probably use
            this Ability for their hijinks.
          %dt Sailing (R)
          %dd
            Large ships that mostly rely on a properly trained crew are operated with this
            Ability, and perhaps suitable social Abilities used in commanding the crew. In
            comparison to boats, a ship can handle larger cargoes and longer journeys,
            making it appropriate for greater endeavors.
          %dt Navigation (R)
          %dd
            Most captains of Near navigate based on memorized coast profiles. This Ability
            can be used to tell where you are and where you should be going.
          %dt Command (I)
          %dd
            A larger ship will often have disciplinary issues, which are largely sorted by
            the captain using this Ability. The Ability is useful for gaining respect and
            getting obeyed; however, it rarely works on people who have not already decided
            to trust your lead.
          %dt Key of the Commission (specify)
          %dd
            The character is responsible to a crew hired for a certain mission. 1xp: Order
            the crew around. 2xp: Justify yourself to the crew. 5xp: Quell a mutiny.
            Buyoff: Abandon the mission.
          %dt Secret of the Captain
          %dd
            The character is a natural captain of a ship. He pays the introduction cost of
            his ship and other naval equipment only the first time it makes an appearance
            in the session.
          %dt Crew Imbuement
          %dd
            The crew of the ship can make Ability checks independently to support the
            character or do things for him. Their Ability level is equal to an applicable
            equipment rating (which cannot be further modified for this purpose by other
            Secrets), and they use the character’s own Pools. Cost: 1 Abilityappropriate
            Pool per check.
          %dt Hold Imbuement
          %dd
            The ship has extra hold for supplies, which translates into Pool: the ship has
            a Pool point that can be used as any Pool by the character. It is refreshed
            when the ship restocks in harbor.
          %dt Luxury Imbuement
          %dd
            The ship has luxurious accommodations for the officers and passengers. This
            might play into issues of refreshment and recovery, but mostly it’s just
            ostentatious.
          %dt Key of the Landlubber
          %dd
            The character is unaccustomed to sea life, and it shows. 1xp: Throw up. 2xp:
            Get ridiculed. 5xp: Fall into the ocean. Buyoff: Save a seaman’s life.
          %dt Key of the Scoundrel Crew
          %dd
            The character has shipped out with a bunch of no-good scoundrels. 1xp: The crew
            drinks or practices other vices. 2xp: Their vices cause trouble. 5xp: Get mixed
            up in their problems. Buyoff: Get out or accept the crew as they are.

      %em Fluff from Yesterday’s Heresies, crunch adapted from the same.
    %p
      The reign of Absolon did more for astronomy than any other science. As his
      royal astronomers divined the existence of eight stars that moved unlike any
      other, he tasked them to find the meaning of these. One was assigned to each
      star and they consulted with their findings until they came up with a radical
      idea.
    %p
      This idea: these were not stars at all. They were the servants of the Sun Lord,
      marching in his heavenly court, each tasked to oversee part of his kingdom.
      Even more radical, they believed that Near was a servant like these, spinning
      in an endless celestial dance. The royal geomancer was enlisted as one of these
      eight, and they formed a society dedicated to the heavenly reign of the Sun and
      the terrestrial reign of Absolon, one and the same. When Absolon took too much
      power and brought the foreign sorcerer Hanish to his side, the Nine struck with
      all their might to end his reign. They were hung for their treachery and fed to
      pigs.
    %p
      Three hundred years later, their knowledge lives on in the Secret Society of
      the Celestial Nine. The Nine are dedicated to the restoration of a Sun King
      over Maldor and will stop at nothing to achieve that. The leader of the Society
      of the Nine is always called NEAR. He fills the ancient spot of the royal
      geomancer, which was also the royal doctor, as the life of the Emperor was
      considered to be tied to the life of the world. His role is to chair the Nine
      in their Orbit, as they call the eternal plan of the world. Below him are the
      eight other Celestials. The name and roles of the Nine are as follows:
    %ul.simple
      %li
        ABRAMOV. Fire and judgment are the domains of Abramov. The person picked for
        this role is always an older person, an ember of life who looks destruction in
        the face daily.
      %li
        PHOLUS. The sky and waters are the domains of Pholus. The person picked for
        this role is always fluid and agile. Pholus may have been a woman at least once
        over the years.
      %li
        NEAR. Life is the domain of Near. The chair of the Nine, he is responsible for
        both human and animal life. The person picked for this role is always a man and
        always has knowledge of the land and of the body.
      %li
        KIEV. Battle and warfare are the domains of Kiev. A point of theological debate
        is whether Kiev made the Sky Fire to smite Near when it was found that Absolon
        was insane. The person picked for this role is always well trained in battle
        and has killed a man.
      %li
        MASAKO. Physical and social power are the domains of Masako. The person picked
        for this role is always immense in stature and a leader of men, often a lord of
        the land.
      %li
        GWANGJU. Magic is the domain of Gwangju. The person picked for this role is
        always knowledgeable in Three-Corner Magic, and sometimes knows other
        traditions.
      %li
        SIJJIN. Penance and absolution are the domains of Sijjin. The counselor of the
        Nine, the person picked for this role has always committed a crime against
        mankind.
      %li
        ENCHIRIDION. Mystery is the domain of Enchiridion. The person picked for this
        role never reveals his true identity to the Nine.
        FAR. Night and darkness are the domains of Far. The person picked for this role
        is always a foreigner.
    %p
      Each of these roles is filled by one person at a time. This person is taught
      secret lores and given potent weapons to fulfill his role. In the case that a
      member of the Nine passes, two of the Nine are tasked to find a replacement and
      initiate him. This person can come from any strata of society. This person is
      almost always a man, and almost always from Maldor.
    %p
      The Nine believe that the new Emperor, the new Sun King, has not been found. In
      each generation, there is one man fit to fill this role in their theology.
      Their goal is to seek him and guide him to rise to power. The cult has never
      succeeded in this goal, perhaps because they all have different ideas about who
      the true king is. They all believe the following things about the Sun King:
    %ul.simple
      %li The Sun King will be a man.
      %li The Sun King will be from Maldor.
      %li The Sun King will be strong in arm and fierce in battle.
      %li The Sun King will be strong in mind and wise in court.
      %li
        The Sun King's heart will be hard enough to make the decision to kill a
        thousand men.
      %li The Sun King's heart will be soft enough to make the decision to save one man.
      %li All Nine will agree on the true Sun King.
    %p
      Their secondary goal derives from the above: no man unworthy shall lead Maldor.
      The Nine have toppled rulers that have come close to uniting Maldor before and
      will do so again.
    %p
      The Nine Celestials usually have access to immense power. At least one of them
      at any time is very wealthy, and at least one of them is a highranking member
      of Maldorite society. In addition, their physical weapons and armor, crafted
      over the years, are very powerful. They are not sworn to secrecy in their role,
      but are assumed to exercise discretion. Revealing part of their secrets to one
      person is one thing; revealing the cult to a crowd is another.
    %p
      The sign of the Nine is a telescope. Each of them carries one. As the secret of
      optics is lost to all but perhaps some craftsmen of Inselburg, this is a rare
      and valuable gift and denotes that the person with one is one of the Nine or
      has taken it from one of them.

        The Nine Celestials hold various rare, esoteric knowledges they use in their
        theology and practical work. Not all is known to each of them, for rarely they
        trust each other completely; rather, it may be assumed that each of the Nine
        has 1-3 pieces of nice crunchy crunch that is not common knowledge in the world
        (and especially Maldor) and that may or may not overlap with that of others.
      %p
        When a new member is initiated into the Nine, the two initiators share their
        secret knowledge with the new member they are sponsoring. This proves their
        trust in the new comrade and provides him with the means to do the work of the

        Each of the Nine have one or more powerful items that help them fill their
        roles. The origin of these items is mostly shrouded in mystery, but at least
        some are of recent origin, potentially replacing lost artifacts, while others
        are definitely from the antiquity, from several bounties of the Empire. All are
        of supreme quality and possess fabulous powers. The intent is that once the Sun
        King is crowned, the Artifacts will be relinquished into his regalia.
      %p
        When using the artifacts in play, determine their quality as equipment
        normally, adding or removing equipment ratings and imbuements as appropriate.
        An artifact may come into play already broken, too. The Story Guide should also
        remember that these are legendary artifacts; it’s no crime to reveal new powers
        lost to time. I would allow a player to check HISTORY (R) to renew the quality
        of an artifact, for example, potentially determining new powers.

        The Nine Celestials make a great slot-in solution for a campaign in Maldor in
        that they’re very simple to bring in: one or more of the group just need to get
        involved with a player character. This can happen when a character stumbles
        upon one of their artifacts they are trying to regain, or when they want to
        initiate a player character into the Nine, or simply when a familiar secondary
        character is revealed to be a member.
      %p
        A player character can also be a member of the Nine himself, no problem. The
        big issue for them in that case is genuineness: do they really believe in the
        Sun King theology, or are they just in it because the conspiracy can help them
        wield power themselves? If the latter, how do they react to co-conspirators who
        genuinely believe, not only in the Sun King, but in him? If the former, what
        about co-conspirators who obviously have other interests?
      %p
        Also, let’s say that Gwangju has witnessed a player character do something that
        makes him think that we have a Sun King here. Do you really think that the next
        thing to happen isn’t a series of murders, as either the prospective Sun King
        and his supporters, his opponents or ingenuine conspirators, or everybody for
        that matter, get killed? They have done it before, and they will do it again.

      %p
        The important lesson to take away from the Nine (and the reason for why I
        included them, aside from my wanting to stress-test my new equipment rules) is
        how Story Guides prepare for playing TSoY. They do not prepare plots; they
        prepare material. The Nine Celestials are essentially an adventure module, it
        just replaces a plot with possibilities.
      %p
        A good SOLAR SYSTEM scenario gives some mechanical possibilities and suggests
        how to introduce them, but leaves the part the players play quite open: player
        characters might decide that the Celestial Nine are assholes, that they are the
        only hope for Maldor, or anything in between. This then becomes story, and the
        Story Guide need do nothing but keep introducing more members of the conspiracy
        (each and every one of them exceptional individuals, I’m sure; think of the
        LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN) while cackling at the players trying to
        figure out how to build a complete picture out of disparate individuals.

            use the SECRET OF EVALUATE and the ThreeCorner ENHANCEMENT: BURST OF POWER. The
            final power is the ability to turn into a Twilight Beast, a ravening wolf-bear
            monster. The beast’s Reason is reduced to 1 level, with the excess split
            between the other Pools. The Twilight Beast’s best Ability is flipped with
            BESTIALITY (V) and the second-best with ENDURE (V), and he gains the SECRET OF
            NATURAL WEAPONS for his claws and form. Becoming the Twilight Beast costs 3

    %p
      %em Original work based on forum discussions with Josh.
    %p
      One thing that I like, but which has not been emphasized much in writing, is
      the idea of regionally important culture. It really is just a convenient
      simplification to say that “Sky God is only known in Goren” or “alchemy is not
      practiced outside Ammeni”; rather, it’s obvious that there are plenty of grey
      areas, and more of them as Near knits back together and the lives of all
      cultures are enriched by trade and other exchanges.
    %p
      Three-Corner magic works like this in my play, and for others: one can’t really
      say conclusively that Three-Corner is a “Maldorite phenomenon”, simply because
      it really is the universal magic, sort of like the magical Latin of Near’s dark
      ages. It might be most common in Maldor and originate there, but all societies
      of Near have to handle it to some degree.
    %p
      Gorenite witchcraft is similar, it’s been in the world for a long time and
      spread and gotten extinguished multiple times, if witches are to be believed.
      Its hold seems to be the strongest in patriarchal societies, which is seen in
      Maldor today, where the derived witchcraft of the Queen of Shadow is very much
      in play.
    %p
      All this means that it would hardly be fair to characterize witchcraft as a
      monolithic phenomenon. Rather, it’s more of a method that can be turned towards
      different purposes, as we can see now.

        The Vadenite islands have been colonized several times from the mainland. The
        latest wave happened when the Empire of Maldor brought in their navy and
        support staff in the early years of Absolon’s reign. The local culture of the
        time was prominently Gorenite, as the Jarls of both Gorens had been banishing
        people there for generations.
      %p
        Today the fortress of Inselburg is home to a hundred Collegiums of more or less
        shining repute. Some magisters are highly public figures, others desire privacy
        or even religious secrecy, while the rumored elven magister of the Skyfire Cult
        is only ever met at initiation ceremonies. However, there is one collegium that
        is not only secretive, but actually illegal on the free islands. The HORNED
        CONSORTIUM flouts the values and personal freedoms of the Vadenites to such a
        degree that it has long been forbidden. Still, the cult endures.
      %p
        The HORNED GOD is a figure of Gorenite myth, one of HER HUSBANDS, the male
        pantheon of the Gorenites. Among the old Vadenite population their worship
        never flagged, and some of it still remains. The Horned God is considered the
        greatest of the bunch by the CONSORTS, his worshippers, who form the illegal
        cult. They believe that the Horned God was not only the first of Her Husbands,
        but yet remains the only lawful one despite her many indiscretions.
      %p
        Members of the cult are quite secretive, but the Vadenite islands are isolated
        and insular, so there are some they rule handily. A few respected public
        personages of Inselburg are also members (including at least one Fleet
        officer), making for a strict separation between their public and private life.
        The cult is also popular among certain parts of the Ammeni princedom, although
        clearly illegal there as well for different reasons.
      %p
        The worst excesses of the cultists involve wholesale degradation of Vadenite
        women, whom they consider little better than beasts and less worthy of respect.
        It is not expected of the lower ranks of initiate, but the higher ones
        routinely capture, rape and murder women they find offensive, or sell them to
        Ammenite slavers. The mystical potency harnessed by these activities is used in
        magic that helps the initiates succeed in all of their endeavors.

          %dd
            This is like the SECRET OF COVENANT RITES, except that the Horned God cannot
            grant Workings or Arcana; instead, after invoking Him, the participants can
            share their Pools freely and sacrifice by the Covenant Rite rules in performing
            Three-Corner magic, and they can include Arcana into their workings as
            Three-Corner Secrets; sacrifices of blood from involuntary women are only worth
            one Pool point per woman, however, no matter the degree of sacrifice. The magic
            done within the ritual is limited by both the Three-Corner laws and the laws of
            High witchcraft, and any spells formed with Arcana only work for characters
            embodying the proper Aspect. The participants gain two extra bonus dice to be

            The character can invoke Hamond the Craftsman in a witchcraft ritual to invest

            surpass its original quality (or the simple crafting Ability check) before the
            ritual, but it may get worse, depending on the check made. Hamond himself
            supplies any magic that involves the item performing its purpose; other magics
            might require other invocations. Cost: 1 VIGOR per magical rating, 1 REASON per
            magical Imbuement, 2 INSTINCT to avoid messing the item’s quality. No discount

            This is the sort of “heroic” exceptional Ability that comes up now and then in
            specific scenarios. It’s not generally known in Near anywhere; it might have
            been concertedly practiced in ancient Hamouad, the Land of Cynics. The Ability
            allows the character to rearrange divine mythology by introspection, by
            mastering symbolic logic and universal aesthetic laws; this is mostly useful
            for poetry, but combined with magic, it can be used to mess with existing
            magical systems to create new ones. Elaborate theologies such as the Gorenite
            pantheon and the Khalean Green World are especially vulnerable, while something

        %a#the-thrice-bound-oaths{:name => "the-thrice-bound-oaths"} The Thrice-Bound Oaths
      %p
        The Consort Magister of the Horned Consortium wields numerous vows that are
        each formalized and taken very seriously by the cult. Furthermore, breaking
        some of the vows, causing certain disfigurations of the body as well as
        horrible nightmares, is necessary for the members to ascend to the highest
        ranks in the Consortium.
      %p
        Members bound by the Oath of Secrecy are taught the TRICKS OF CONSPIRACY, used
        by the cult in their work. They are expected to participate in the cult’s
        illegal activities. (Other typical tricks of the Horned God involve STRENGTH,
        WOMEN, ANIMALS, NIGHT and HUNT.)
      %p The Oath of Fealty is only required of members that profess religious interest in the worship of the Horned God. It provides the ARCANA OF HORN: RENEW, which is useless for a cultist without the KEY OF THE HORNED GOD.
      %p
        Finally, the Oath of Revenge is for desperate members who join the cult for
        passionate reasons. They are taught the SECRET OF VENGEFUL BLOW and the magical
        foci needed to use it, as well as other things they need to exact their
        revenge. The cult does not expect much of these initiates unless and until
        blackmailing them with their association provides some tangible reward.
      %p
        However, these are just the three lower orders of the cult. The real core of
        the cult commits to the “Thrice-Bound Oath” of the Horned God, gaining the
        SECRET OF RAISING THE HORN in return. The ThriceBound Oath may only be
        fulfilled by breaking at least one of the earlier Oaths, which all a character
        has to have sworn to get this far. Each Oath has a symbolical punishment:
        breaking the Oath of Secrecy causes nightmares that impart sacred knowledge,
        breaking the Oath of Fealty withers a finger off the character’s hand and
        breaking the Oath of Revenge causes terrible sores to his lower parts while he
        sleeps.
      %p
        The three lower orders are routinely granted by any Thrice-Bound cultist, while
        the Thrice-Bound Oath itself is only administered by the Consort Magister
        Thomas Conne himself. While the lesser vows are only associated with minimal
        crunch, all further witchery and Three-Corner spellcraft known to the cult
        associates with the Thrice-Bound Oath, providing a substantial discount in Pool
        costs. Breaking this last oath in part or full has drastic consequences; the
        Oaths held by Conne are LEGENDARY (5) and promise torture, death and a
        torturous afterlife.
      %p
        The Thrice-Bound circle of the cult convenes twice each year for a great hunt,
        preferably conducted on mainland in either Jošland or Maldor. The hunt is
        assisted by favored lower order associates and conducted for the purpose of
        RAISING THE HORN and any major Three-Corner spellcraft the cult needs done. The
        hunt concerns animals and women encountered, with targets released from cages
        if necessary.
      %p
        The Horned Consortium possesses a limited form of High witchcraft in the RITE
        MAGNIFICENT, as they do not benefit from the Covenant rites: invoking the
        Horned God does not allow ritual Workings or drawing forth Arcana. However, the
        Consorts have preserved knowledge of the GIFT OF HAMOND, eponymous for Her
        Husband the Craftsman. The ritual procedure itself is essentially similar to
        Gorenite witchcraft, the Consorts just need to invoke the Horned God instead of
        the Goddess. (If you’re wondering, like I did: the reason for why they don’t
        have to invoke Hamond to use his Secret is that their theology allows the
        Horned God to force the matter upon Hamond. Probably not many cult members who
        could uphold the Aspect of Hamond, anyway. Hamond’s Aspect Ability is probably
        CRAFTWORK (I), by the way.)
      %p
        If some of the Consortium crunch seems overly expensive to you without the
        magistery discounts, keep in mind that the Consortium is very young in its
        current form; it was the father of Thomas, Ezkil Conne, who transformed the
        collegium’s traditional practices, included Three-Corner knowledge garnered
        from refugee Maldorites and displaced the old men who used to control the much
        less disruptive old collegium. Only active theurgy made the current theology of
        the cult possible at all; presumably the practice would become more efficient
        with time, were the cult to become established and comfortable in their craft.

        Conne wants to use the Black Ships to actively impose order on the Southern

        with Ammeni traders, especially as they would be forced to agree to any
        guarantees or tolls required by the Vadenites after the full unleashing of the

        The Horned Consortium is an example of the sort of stuff I’d expect in my own
        play; I haven’t playtested it – I’ve been playing with the new basic crunch in
        this book, haven’t had time. Still, when you get a game going with a group
        experienced in TSoY, turn the knobs south and let it rip.
      %p
        The elements typical of actual play (as opposed to general treatise) here are
        the highly specific crunch that might only be possessed by one person in the
        world at its extreme, the free mention of individual characters and the
        situation in action; like the last chapter, this one is also a SCENARIO waiting
        to happen.
      %p
        Also typical is the amount of synergy and influences that jump from one
        cultural sphere to another. It’s easy to forget when reading the neatly
        apportioned chapters of this book, but not only is Near on the brink of a new
        global era, but player characters and other exceptional, dramatic individuals
        are expected to do stuff like inventing a religion on a flimsy basis, combining
        two diametrically opposed magic systems into a cult empowered by a third one,
        and trying to jump start a maritime empire.

        The Horned God was not evil, originally. Redemption attempts are encouraged,

        It might be that only an Eclectic could successfully subvert and reveal the
        inner cult; those Thrice-Bound Oaths are a pretty good guarantee of loyalty.
        Where to get one when you need him?
      %p
        Even if the Consortium is evil (I sort of hope that you agree with me that it
        is, although the game works swimmingly either way), Thomas Conne might be just
        intellectually lazy and/or fanatical. What if his goals are a good idea?

        An original motivation for including this chapter was that I didn’t have room
        for the witchcraft magic item creation rules in chapter 18. Do reintegrate if

        A valley lies between Maldor and Ammeni, yet no caravans go there and no lord
        desires it. It is a cursed place, punished to this day for the callous
        atrocities committed during the Year of Night by Esau Neverfull, Count of
        Casnic. The valley's curse is simple, direct, and blunt: Beast shall not serve
        man.
      %p
        As the story has it, Esau, a Companion of Absolon, looked to save his county
        from the Shadow Night by wizardry. Sapa the Assartist created for him SIJJIN'S
        FARRO: a grain that needed no light nor warmth to grow, but required blood and
        carrion in addition to water and soil. The peasantry initially accepted this
        was necessary for survival, but their support waned when animals – livestock,
        pets, and working animals of all forms – began to fall ill and die. The
        uprising began in earnest, however, when word spread that the Count's men
        attempted to nourish the farro with human sacrifice.

          The peasantry survived until the sun rose again, but they discovered the
          further costs of Sijjin's farro. Sapa created a grain that sent animals wild
          with its bloom, when the hazy grey pollen of the grain was sent into the air. A
          little of the pollen makes tame animals wild and wild ones hostile; a lot sends
          them all careening into an irrecoverable madness.

          Centuries after the world began anew, this curse of the farro is still in

        The Sirepani live in a primarily agricultural society with a decentralized

        This whole scenario is written with a completely character-based paradigm: I
        the Story Guide look at the Keys and other important facets that characters
        have, and then produce content that resonates with those elements. This is a
        particular method for creating adventures, and not the only possibility; it’s a
        good one, however, and educative to present here.
      %p
        When working with this sort of Story Guiding philosophy, there’s an useful
        word: a FLAG is any clearly signaled plan or wish a player has for the game,
        especially one that is written down and presented clearly to the Story Guide.
        The Keys are, of course, all flags, and other crunch might be as well.
      %p
        As it says on the box, this sort of adventure is tailored to the specific
        characters to some degree. It’ll be hit and miss whether it’ll suit a different
        set of protagonists. They often do (people aren’t that different), but it’s not
        guaranteed.

        Here are the flags that I had to work with when developing the content. As can
        be seen, I don’t actually care how many characters there are or which
        characters go with which flags; the idea is not to tailor the content to the
        characters, but just to make sure there exists content that is pertinent to
        them. The players take care of orienteering their characters towards content
        that interests them.
      %p
        One of the characters was an elf, one was goblin. One had an intelligent
        blood-drinking sword. Two had the Key of Glittering Gold, and then there were
        the Keys of Magician, Impostor, Masochist, Community, Renown and Bloodlust.
      %p
        Looking at the list, the sword and bloodlust are the same thing for our
        purposes; I’ve removed the Key of the Masochist from this book, I didn’t
        understand then and don’t understand now what was interesting about it; the
        other flags all factored into my scenario design.
      %p
        It’s notable that the player characters are explicitly a group of adventurers
        out looking for the ancient Zaru capital. This goes a long way in explaining
        why their motivations are relatively superficial; it’s not a problem, the Story
        Guide just needs to prepare for simple and cinematic scenes, not for
        understated drama.
      %p
        Note that relying on flags is ultimately about trusting the players to actually
        know what they are interested in. This is not a given; less experienced players
        will actually choose Keys they will not enjoy or care of due to all sorts of
        confusion. So don’t stare blindly at what the players have written down, even
        if by rights they shouldn’t have written things they don’t mean.

      %p
        The ancient Zaru capital was the First City, built when farming was invented
        long ago in the Zaru heartland. The language of Zu had started spreading
        outside the Zaru lands, and as it spread, it weakened; the people could no
        longer be supported in the city, and thus they followed their language and
        spread over the land, farming it. The First City itself, once heavily
        populated, was left to decline.
      %p
        I imagine the citizens of that time as lithe, tall people with big oval heads
        and loose robes. That’s what the peoples of lost civilizations look like in
        CONAN comics.
      %p
        The slow, leisurely decline of the Zaru city was interrupted by a Maldorian
        CULTURAL INSPECTION unit. These were hero bands sent by the Three-Corner
        Academy into the wide world to do adventure anthropology during the latter half
        of Absolon’s reign: go into communities of the various subject peoples,
        interview them and live with them, spy or trade or intimidate their secrets out
        of them and report back to the Academy to enrich the academic knowledge base.
        The Three-Corner magic was created out of this basic work.
      %p
        The mission of this particular CI unit was to pillage the First City for any
        secrets of Zu yet to be released to the public, and bring back enough experts
        to help fill out the still lacking understanding of Zu in the academic circles.
        According to reports that came back, the CI unit was welcomed in the city with
        open arms. However, something went wrong, and the CI unit never came back.

            it’s high on the fluff alone, but I didn’t mention there that I see this as a

      %p
        The City itself is just your run of the mill ruined fantasy city; the Story
        Guide can improvise the narrative details of something like that easily enough.
        What makes the scenario are its specific elements:
      %p
        The Community and Goblin flags are pinged by a goblin tribe living in the city.
        They’re really primitive, and pathetically grateful to any civilized being who
        treats them with kindness. However, they want any benefactors to join their
        Tribe of the Crystal by swallowing a sharp, fist-sized crystal chunk broken off
        a mysterious building. They’re quite insistent. The thing is, a non-goblin
        would surely die from swallowing the sharp stone. Goblin anatomy on the other
        hand adapts, ousting the crystal halfway, leaving it stuck on the goblin’s
        tummy as a tribal symbol. Being that humans usually die when they try to join
        the tribe, the goblins tend to be skeptical about them.
      %p
        The Glittering Gold flag is pinged by the crystal itself: pieces are really
        valuable, but they're also sacred to the goblins, and dangerous to get (a giant
        lizard lives in the building with the crystal, for example), and you have to be
        a master artisan to polish them, unless you harvest directly from live goblins,
        whose stomach juices polish the crystal into an ethereal shine.
      %p
        The Magician and Elf flags are pinged by the elf Nether, who was trapped under
        the City in the calamity that ruined the place. Nether was a member of the CI
        unit and has been stuck under the city ever since; either he’s afraid to die,
        or he gets reincarnated in the same place due to a Zaru curse, or he’s just too
        stubborn and committed to die and leave FORMULAE TRIANGULI ZUONIS CONDITA, the
        incomplete book of integrating Zu into Three-Corner magic. Whichever the case,
        Nether would promise almost anything to anybody who freed him. Nether is a
        MAGUS of the Academy, meaning that he’s mastered multiple arts; one of those is
        spirit shamanism, which he uses to walk in the city in spirit and seek help,
        desperate for human contact.
      %p
        The Bloodlust flags get pinged by the aforementioned large lizard. It was a pet
        of a CI unit member who died here, and it’s been living and growing here ever
        since, solitary and forlorn.  It’s huge and nasty and quite able to follow
        adventurers out of the city, should it be necessary; it still remembers Nether
        and while not humanintelligent, it is faithful and patient.
      %p
        More Glittering Gold is found in the city as ancient Zaru coinage; the gold was
        used to buy off barbarians and trade. The trick with the gold is that it’s
        being guarded by a number of ghostly sasha, ancient Zaru elders (those forehead
        guys in flowing robes). They’ve trapped the elf under the city ruins, which
        keeps their sashas intact through the ages, waiting for a worthy hero who’d
        take the gold and use it for Zaru liberation.
      %p
        The Impostor flag is amply serviced by the elements above: the goblins would be
        happy to be misled, the elf is desperate for sweet promises and the ancient
        Zaru ghosts are as gullible as only three centuries old pacifists in bathrobes
        can be.
      %p
        Finally, Renown comes into play in the form of an outsider: a cocky Khalean or
        wily Ammenite adventurer has followed the player characters into the city. He’s
        eager to help, faithful in action, and a total glory-hound after the fact,
        willing to lie about his actions. If he’s allowed to stick around, he’s going
        to steal the glory from the character who’d be gaining the sweet xp otherwise.
      %p
        As can be seen, this stuff is totally purposeful; I don’t dwell on fictional
        detail or poetics at this stage, I just pull out concepts that have significant
        interaction with what and who the player characters are. The same method would
        work no matter what the flags, as long as the premise of the game is to have
        player characters arrive and explore a new environment, learning as they go.
      %p
        Note that even while this is a Zaru city, I do no more than hint at the Zaru
        signature magic, Zu. The goblins, the elf and the ghosts all hold Zu, add it
        liberally.
      %p
        Also note that I’m listing these advance preparations as KEY ELEMENTS in the
        crunch. I rarely use Key Elements myself in play, but that’s just because I
        don’t often do these preparations on paper; if I had more than some scattered
        thoughts in my head, I might well use Key Elements as well.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#situations{:name => "situations"} Situations
      %p
        I don’t always prepare more than one or two compelling SITUATIONS (called BANGS
        in many games) explicitly, but it’s a good practice if you find yourself
        searching for content to proceed with in the middle of a game.
      %p
        For this material, there are many obvious interactions that can be brought to
        the fore whenever the action is lagging and the Story Guide needs to propose
        something. Like so:
      %ul.simple
        %li Meeting the goblins.
        %li The goblins use their crystal Zu.
        %li The goblins offer a character tribe membership and initiation.
        %li
          A support character suggests that the goblins could be gutted for a rich
          harvest in crystals.
        %li
          A support character suggests that the lizard could be distracted to loot
          crystals from their origin.
        %li The elf appears to somebody, asking for help.
        %li
          The elf is a wreck after spending 300 years in captivity; needs major emotional
          support.
        %li The giant lizard approaches an amiable character, seeking friendship.
        %li The gold is found.
        %li The Zaru ghosts are encountered.
        %li
          The ghosts show the gold to a character and ask him to dispose of it
          honorably in aid of Zaru people.
        %li
          The ghosts ask things of the world, making it obvious that they really are very
          gullible.
        %li The glory-hound adventurer is spotted and encountered.
        %li
          The glory-hound shows his colors by trying to steal credit, or take it
          rightfully.
        %li The lizard follows the group and seeks revenge.
      %p
        Note that the situations are not in any order and do not represent a plot plan;
        they are just obvious imperatives, based on what the different characters in
        the scenario want.
      %p
        Situations are useful to list in that they might help to remind you in the
        middle of the game about the different issues in the story. You can cross them
        over as you introduce them into the game, and when everything’s been both
        introduced and dealt with, the adventure is over. This is a very general model
        of Story Guiding work: prepare material, throw out material for the players to
        deal with, close the books and send everybody home after getting through your
        material. Simple.
    .section
      %h3
        %a#writing-your-own{:name => "writing-your-own"} Writing Your Own
      %p
        As you can see, it’s easy to write this sort of scenario; Story Guiding it in
        practice is slightly more difficult, mainly because the players can make it
        easier or more difficult for you. To ease your work, keep the AUTHORSHIP VEIL
        that develops for the Story Guide as low as possible: make sure the players are
        continuously aware not only of their vast rights under the SOLAR SYSTEM, but
        also of their responsibility towards you as a co-player. Do not walk into the
        trap of pretending immunity; show it when the other players confuse you or play
        in ways you don’t appreciate.
      %p
        Still, assuming that the group communicates well and the Story Guide has
        actually understood what he’s supposed to do with the prepared elements, this
        method can be a powerful tool for you. To repeat, here are the technical steps
        in a nutshell:
      %ol.arabic.simple
        %li
          Look at the characters and recognize their flags. List them out. Don’t
          forget to be critical and remove false flags, and add things you know the
          players will like but which they didn’t write out.
        %li
          Choose your fictional milieu and populate it with secondary characters that
          “ping” or resonate with those flags you listed. They should resonate because
          their own, understandable interests are somehow relevant to the flags, not
          because you’ve preplanned actions they’ll take or the player characters take.
        %li
          Refine a list of situations from your list of people and places: remember
          that situations should be both interesting and open, as per the SOLAR SYSTEM.
        %li Create new crunch to taste.
        %li
          When playing, feed appropriate situations to the players, see how they
          react, play the consequences objectively and hard. Let the story emerge.
        %li
          Once you have all of your scenario elements on the table and well
          introduced, start driving towards conclusion of any storylines that have not
          resolved yet. Once they do, you’ve finished the story. In my experience this
          method works nearly always. To put it simply, this’ll fail only if the players
          do not engage with your prepared material for some reason.
  .section
    %h2
      %a#going-out-advice-and-hints{:name => "going-out-advice-and-hints"} Going Out: Advice and Hints
    %p
      %em Draws on many forum discussions and almost all publications.
    %p
      I’ll quote Clinton here, because he said it best: “I really want you and your
      group to take this world and run with it. Whatever you decide is up is great.”
    %p
      That’s pretty much what we’ve done through the last couple of years, developing
      the ideas you’ve seen in this book. Using the entire Near in one grand,
      holistic campaign was difficult and pointless before; now it’s all but
      impossible, as the game has fractured into many different directions as
      inspiration has taken it. This plurality engendered by free communication and
      the Internet is a new thing insofar as roleplaying game settings go; we have
      something that is at the same time flexible, concrete and shared.
    %p
      While putting this book together I’ve been thinking about this same thing from
      a different angle, thinking about what roleplayers expect roleplaying game
      settings to be. My ultimate conclusion is that while we think of a setting as a
      pre-existing world we utilize in different manners, this can never really be in
      actual, real play at the table. When we play, the books are always there as
      reference material only, as something to read from when, moment-to-moment, it
      is more rewarding or useful to look for answers in the book.
    %p
      Still, looking at my own play, the book has never been our primary source when
      we’ve played THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY. That source was always the PLAY ITSELF.
      This might be difficult to understand, but when you play and the game really
      breathes for you, it is obvious: you are the one who sees the setting, and you
      know how things need to be to fulfill the needs of this campaign, this session
      right here. The book can only ever be a starting point for this process. There
      might be different methods for using settings in adventure roleplaying games
      like SOLAR SYSTEM, but I’ve yet to master them; this style I know, and I know
      that the best kind of setting book for it is one that only provides the
      interesting inspiration, leaving the details for us to see with our own eyes in
      play.
    %p
      To round off this overview of Near, here are some notes about what lies beyond.
      Insofar as I know, nobody has played with these ideas; many of them have hardly
      been discussed. For those who enjoy breaking completely new ground in their
      play and Story Guiding, there is much yet to discover. Whatever I could write
      could not be as authoritative as the facts you reveal by actually going there
      and seeing for yourself.
    .list.container
      %dl.docutils
        %dt Exploration (I)
        %dd
          While most peoples of Near are still wrapped in their own problems, some choice
          individuals look beyond the hills and see those that come from the clash of
          whole cultures. Many are from Ammeni, which is sort of grim. Still, this
          Ability can be taken by anybody with the heart of an adventurer. It can be used
          to know stories about faraway places, write concise accounts of the same and,
          in the highest scale, conduct successful expeditions.
        %dt Secret of the Unknown
        %dd
          The character can use EXPLORATION (I) or STORYTELLING (R) to establish KEY
          ELEMENTS (as per the SOLAR SYSTEM) with total experience value equal to the
          check result. These are always things about which the character knows nothing
          certain, such as the lost valley of Sireap or the Gharialin Templar. Cost: 1
          REASON per check.
        %dt Key of Exploration
        %dd
          The character yearns for the unknown. 1xp: Hear of an unknown place. 2xp:
          Discover things you’ve never seen before. 5xp: Discover something that isn’t in
          this book. Buyoff: Settle down.

        %a#outside-near{:name => "outside-near"} Outside Near
      %p
        Is “Near” the planet or the continent? Sources disagree. Regardless, I like the
        notion that outside Near the design precepts start to tear up in ways
        challenging for the group that chooses to explore them: “no gods, no monsters,
        just people” and other basic themes may give way in unexpected manner beyond
        where Hanish could see.
      %p
        I am always careful of the tone in Near, but beyond those borders (wherever
        they are, geographically speaking) all bets are off. In fact, I might consider
        this as the real definition of Near.

        %p
          I know only one thing for sure about what lies beyond the mountains: if you
          thought that Near was broken by the Skyfire incident, life is probably about a
          thousand times worse on the side not protected from the impact.
        %p
          I imagine coasts mired into a muddy morass by giant waves for hundreds of miles
          inland. I imagine plains of glass caused by celestial heat. I imagine sandy
          deserts scoured of all life.

          I have this impression that to the west, beyond the Roof of the World, lies a

          rivers and divided by the enormous distances.

          believe that anybody could have survived the Skyfire beyond the Aegis of
          Absolon, but who knows.
        %p
          When the Hamouadi ruled in the past and the Wound of Heaven was yet to be,
          their influence was mighty; only the jungles of Qek separated them from the
          Empire of Maldor in the age of the empires. The city of Kalderon was built to
          curb their influence in the Oranide plains, which at that time extended far to
          the north and around the Roof of the World.

          and monstrous. They are powered by geomantic energies, while the people of the
          land are cursed to never touch the land or the sky in fear of their anger. I
          suspect that the answers to the mystery of Pere-di-Fey are to be found here.

          remain beyond the Wound of Heaven.
        %p
          My sources indicate that the people of Shar-Tek have a permanent geomantic knot
          on their mountain home, in which they hold alien technology or magic from the
          north. I’m pretty sure that these are the people Clinton mentioned once, the

        I’ve been playing THE SHADOW OF YESTERDAY a lot lately, while writing and
        editing this book. I probably will take a break afterwards. But once I return
        to gaming in Near, I know what the name of my next campaign is going to be:
      %p FAR: A PLANETARY ROMANCE
      %p
        Actually, that might be the name of a book, although I’ve told everybody to not
        encourage me about that. Anyway, as the careful reader has noticed, Near has
        certain celestial connections. I’m seeing the potential for some unholy cross
        of BARSOOM, NINE WORLDS and SPELLJAMMER here.

      %a#a-love-letter-to-a-storygamer{:name => "a-love-letter-to-a-storygamer"} A Love Letter to a Storygamer
    %p
      An acquaintance spent last spring playing TSoY. I think that he might have
      overheated, for afterwards he could recount me the whole length of the history
      of Near, beginning several years before the Skyfire and ending with the
      Glorious Reascent of Yelm – that is, Absolon – no, Absolonda, I mean.
    %p
      A certain irreverence and willingness to take on a narrative challenge even at
      the risk of failure is something we share in our tastes, so I can appreciate
      how he laughingly steals inspiration and makes it his own, using the wildest
      sources and refusing to follow conventions blindly. It’s a sort of narrative
      maturity, a refusal to hide behind the veil of authorship: we all know the
      pieces that stories are made of, so there’s no point in pretending to
      originality or a suspension of disbelief when you just want to tell and
      experience stories. Everybody at the table saw what you just did, but you don’t
      care, because you’re all in on the joke. I’ve found that in roleplaying I can
      at the same time be totally cynical and superficial in my sources, but also
      committed to taking the resulting story seriously; this is a lot like the way
      an author feels. There is no man behind the curtain, there is just us.
    %p
      I was told that there was no Absolon, to begin with. She was called Absolonda,
      the grandmother. Ridiculous, of course, but there was proof: she had left a set
      of diaries (in true Jane Austen style) for safekeeping with a clan of dwarves
      concerned with history.
    %p
      Furthermore, there was a boon that would change the shape of the world: a
      doorway to another world. As she would have it, one day a band of heroes would
      arrive through the doorway, make a mess of things and then set everything
      right. Now it stands abandoned somewhere in Sireap Valley, long forgotten by
      everybody.
    %p
      Then there was also serious trouble in Qek: bodies of long-dead behemoths,
      brought up from tar pits by abusive spirit-talkers, were being fought to a
      standstill by the largest of apes: because of ancient jungle law there is
      always a larger ape, and thus the latter could ultimately crush the former, but
      not before causing great destruction. At this point the story got somewhat
      crazy, but I was assured that it was not only completely serious, but also
      going somewhere.
    %p
      You see, it did not matter that setting canon and expected style was being
      broken, as long as the characters in the story believed in their roles, the
      Story Guide believed in the consequences of any actions taken, and the players
      believed in the story more than mere setting facts. Whatever the story would be
      in genre and message, that would be revealed after the fact, not before.

      People have been dying in Maldor a lot. Forcing a Qek necromancer to travel
      there to do a resurrection job was not the smartest of moves. Now the dead are
      rising en masse, and nobody knows what to do.

      The only real man’s way of having a sword duel is with light sabers, as
      everybody knows. You can make one out of semi-common ingredients, such as
      Three-Corner wizards properly motivated, or by proving your talents to a
      Highland Saint.

      Trollbabes are something that’s been very current for me lately. These lovely
      lasses are all goblin and all woman. Meeting one is fun, because she’s not
      actually a part of this story, but she’s going to meddle in it anyway, just
      like a player character.

      I was, of course, not believing a word of it. Especially not when Agarim got
      involved, and he was just a big wolf.

      I think that part of it is a relaxed knowledge that you can write yourself up
      the tree and down the tree and around the tree if you want; there’s no hard
      need to get everything right and perfect anymore like there was when we were
      teenagers emulating Lord of the Rings; we’ve done the genre fantasy thing
      already, now we can just enjoy the elements and mix them anew.

      Everybody who knew Absolonda had been long dead, of course. Fortunately, there
      is the so-called “Schrödinger Gambit”: travel back in time via the Green World,
      meet with Absolonda and then return, which would retroactively bring back her
      sasha, the spirit of memory. Don’t try it at home without proper guidance.

      Elves make for mean assassins when they want to. There’s no point, though: no
      matter how many Prefects she suicide-bombs by surprise, they just elect more of
      them. It’s an eternal war, and thinking up a new way of sneaking into the
      fortress sort of gets old after a while.

      Three-Corner wizardry is considered weak, but that’s just because the third
      trinity is not known on Near. The space goblins don’t have it much better,
      frankly, as they lack the Day trinity in turn. But combine those knowledges and
      you’re on the verge of discovering the Tenth Focus.

      Opening a door to another world is easy when you know how. Aside from Soft
      Places, you can always use Wondersmithing, if you can get the dwarves to do it.
      There is no point, though: the heroes were us all along.

      Thus, great adventures were had, and verily Story Guides took every possible
      opportunity to draw in multitudes of intertextual references and pop-culture
      shoutouts. The wildest of ideas, once brought afoot, were grabbed completely
      seriously and compelled to do the work of a thousand men.
    %p
      And despite all this, still characters were made to do as their hearts bid
      them, and still great feats were attempted and recorded in sincerity, themes
      were realized and art was created, which made it all worthwhile.
